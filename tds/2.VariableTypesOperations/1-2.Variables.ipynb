    "### **Key Characteristics of Variables:**\n",

    "1. **Case Sensitivity**: Python is case-sensitive. `age` and `Age` are different variables.\n",
    "2. **Descriptive Names**: Use meaningful names (e.g., `student_name` instead of `s`).\n",
    "3. **Snake Case**: Use lowercase letters with underscores for multiple words (e.g., `user_age`).\n",
    "4. **Avoid Keywords**: Do not use Python keywords (e.g., `if`, `for`, `while`) as variable names.\n",
    "5. **Start with Letter or Underscore**: Names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or underscore (_), followed by letters, numbers, or underscores.\n",
    "6. **No Spaces**: Avoid spaces in variable names.\n",
    "7. **Private Variables**: Use a leading underscore (e.g., `_private_var`) to indicate internal use.\n",
    "8. **Constants**: Use uppercase letters with underscores (e.g., `MAX_VALUE`)."

    "### **2.3 Practice Session: Defining and Naming Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this session is to get comfortable with the basic syntax of creating variables and to practice using the standard Python naming conventions. For each task, create the variable and assign it the specified value. You can use the `print()` function to see the value you've stored (e.g., `print(company_name)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Company Identity**: Create a variable named `company_name` to store the name of a company, for example, `\"Global Finance Corp\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Stock Ticker**: Create a variable to hold a stock ticker symbol. Following the convention for constants (since a ticker for a specific stock doesn't change), name it `TICKER_SYMBOL` and assign it the value `\"GFC\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Share Count**: Imagine you own 1,250 shares of this company. Create a variable called `number_of_shares` to store this whole number.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Market Price**: The current price of the stock is $195.50. Create a variable named `current_price` to store this decimal value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Profitability Check**: The company reported a profit last quarter. Create a variable `is_profitable` and assign it the boolean value `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Internal ID**: For internal tracking, each analyst is assigned an ID. Create a variable `_analyst_id` to store an internal ID, like `734`. This practices the convention for internal-use variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Price Update**: The stock price just changed! On a new line after you created `current_price`, update its value to `197.25`. This demonstrates that variables can be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  **Portfolio Value**: Calculate the total value of your stock holding. Create a new variable called `total_portfolio_value` and assign it the result of multiplying `number_of_shares` by the updated `current_price`.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.  **Temporary Calculation Cleanup**: You created a temporary variable for a quick check, `temp_risk_score = 0.85`. After using it, you no longer need it. Use the `del` statement to remove this variable from memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Bonus Challenge: Client Report Summary**:\n",
    "    *   Create three variables: `client_name` set to `\"John Smith\"`, `account_number` set to `98765`, and `portfolio_value` set to `55430.75`.\n",
    "    *   The goal is to practice creating multiple related variables that follow good naming conventions (`snake_case`). You'll learn how to combine them into a nice report message in the next section"
