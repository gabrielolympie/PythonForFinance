    "So far, we've written scripts that run from top to bottom. This is fine for simple tasks, but as our analysis becomes more complex, we'll find ourselves writing the same lines of code over and over again. For example, calculating a percentage return might be something we need to do for dozens of different stocks.\n",

    "To manage this complexity, we need to organize our code into logical, reusable blocks. This is the core principle behind **functions** and **classes**. By structuring our code, we make it:\n",

    "*   **Reusable**: We can execute the same logic multiple times without copying and pasting (the \"Don't Repeat Yourself\" or DRY principle).\n",

    "A **function** is a named block of code that performs a specific task. You can \"call\" a function whenever you need to execute that task. Think of it like a recipe: you define the steps once, and then you can follow that recipe (call the function) anytime you want to make the dish.\n",

    "\n",
    "As your collection of useful functions grows, you won't want to copy and paste them into every new script or Jupyter Notebook. Python allows you to save your functions in a separate file, called a **module**, and then `import` them whenever you need them. This is how you can build your own reusable toolkit for financial analysis.\n",

    "#### **Step 1: Create a Python Script (`.py` file)**\n",
    "Using your code editor (like VS Code, Spyder, or even the text editor in JupyterLab), create a new file and save it with a `.py` extension. For this example, let's call it `finance_tools.py`.\n",

    "**Important:** This file must be saved in the same directory as the notebook or script you plan to use it in.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 2: Define Functions in Your Module**\n",
