    "\n",
    "We've learned how to store collections of data in lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. But what if your portfolio has 500 stocks instead of 4? Manually accessing `portfolio[0]`, `portfolio[1]`, `portfolio[2]`, and so on, is not practical. To work with data structures effectively—especially large ones—we need to automate repetitive tasks and make decisions within our code.\n",

    "*   **Iterate**: Perform an action for every item in a collection (`for` loops).\n",
    "*   **Repeat**: Perform an action repeatedly as long as a condition is true (`while` loops).\n",
    "*   **Decide**: Execute different code blocks based on specific conditions (`if-elif-else`).\n",
    "*   **Handle Errors**: Gracefully manage code that might fail without crashing the program (`try-except`)."

    "### **5.1 Iteration with `for` Loops**\n",
    "A **`for` loop** is the most common way to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string). It executes a block of code once for each item in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for variable_name in sequence:\n",
    "    # Code to execute for each item\n",
    "    # This block is indented\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Looping Through a List or Tuple**\n",
    "This is the most straightforward use case. The loop assigns each item of the list to the `variable_name` one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "portfolio_tickers = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOG', 'JPM']\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Client Holdings:\")\n",
    "for ticker in portfolio_tickers:\n",
    "    print(f\"- {ticker}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Client Holdings:\n",
    "- AAPL\n",
    "- MSFT\n",
    "- GOOG\n",
    "- JPM\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Looping Through a Dictionary**\n",
    "You can loop through a dictionary's keys, values, or both.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "stock_profile = {'name': 'Apple Inc.', 'ticker': 'AAPL', 'sector': 'Technology'}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Looping through both keys and values using .items() - VERY useful!\n",
    "for key, value in stock_profile.items():\n",
    "    print(f\"{key.title()}: {value}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Looping with `range()`**\n",
    "If you need to loop a specific number of times, the `range()` function is perfect.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Run a financial model simulation 5 times\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    print(f\"Running simulation attempt #{i + 1}\")\n",

    "2.  **Sum of Prices**: Create a list of prices: `[150.5, 220.0, 130.25]`. Loop through the list and calculate the sum of all prices. Print the final sum. (Hint: Create a `total` variable initialized to 0 before the loop).\n",
    "3.  **Company Profile**: Create a dictionary `{'company': 'NVIDIA', 'price': 450.0}`. Loop through its items and print each key-value pair in the format: `\"Key -> Value\"`.\n",
    "4.  **Quarterly Reports**: Use `range()` to print the messages `\"Generating report for Q1\"`, `\"Generating report for Q2\"`, `\"Generating report for Q3\"`, and `\"Generating report for Q4\"`. (Hint: `range(1, 5)`)."
