content: "HONG KONG: Asian markets tumbled Tuesday following painful losses in New\
  \ York and Europe while the euro sat near nine-year lows as political uncertainty\
  \ in Greece fanned renewed fears it could leave the eurozone.Oil prices, which fell\
  \ below the psychological $50 a barrel mark in US trade, edged up marginally but\
  \ remained under pressure owing to a global supply glut, weak demand and a stronger\
  \ dollar.Tokyo tumbled 2.50 percent, Hong Kong lost 0.89 percent, Sydney eased 1.67\
  \ percent, Seoul was 1.30 percent lower while Shanghai reversed earlier losses to\
  \ gain 0.70 percent.The first full week of the new year got off to a traumatic start\
  \ for dealers as they bet a January 25 general election in Greece will see a victory\
  \ for the the left-wing Syriza party.Markets fear the party will roll back austerity\
  \ measures required under the IMF-EU bailout of the country, which could in turn\
  \ lead it to exit the eurozone.The year is \"barely three trading days old and already\
  \ the two biggest themes that were predicted to affect the markets this year are\
  \ making headlines: oversupply of commodities and the eurozone,\" Evan Lucas, a\
  \ markets strategist in Melbourne at IG Ltd., wrote in an email to clients, according\
  \ to Bloomberg News.At the weekend, Der Spiegel quoted German government sources\
  \ as saying they consider Greece´s exit \"almost inevitable\" if Syriza wins the\
  \ snap poll.Chancellor Angela Merkel and finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble had\
  \ come to consider Athens´ removal from the bloc would be \"manageable\", the magazine\
  \ said.However, investors were spooked and on Monday Greek stocks sank more than\
  \ 5 percent, while the Paris, Madrid and Milan exchanges fell more than 3 percent.-\
  \ Oil below $50 a barrel -The Dow dived 1.86 percent, the S&P 500 fell 1.83 percent\
  \ and the Nasdaq lost 1.57 percent.In currency trade the euro sank to $1.1864 Monday,\
  \ its lowest level since March 2006. On Tuesday morning the single currency recovered\
  \ slightly buying $1.1943.The euro was meanwhile at 142.58 yen against 142.74 yen\
  \ in US trade and well down from the 144.58 yen Friday.Adding to downward pressure\
  \ is increased speculation that the European Central Bank will buy eurozone government\
  \ bonds to counter deflation risks.The dollar was at 119.40 yen early Tuesday, compared\
  \ with 119.61 in New York Monday and also well down from 120.46 yen Friday.Oil prices\
  \ were marginally up Tuesday after slipping below $50 for the first time in more\
  \ than five years in New York.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for February\
  \ delivery rose eight cents to $50.12 while Brent crude for February gained 14 cents\
  \ to $53.25. WTI tapped $49.95 Monday.The cost of crude has plunged since June as\
  \ supplies outstrip demand with key consumer China slowing down, the eurozone struggling\
  \ and the dollar, in which it is priced, strengthening.A decision late last year\
  \ by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to maintain output\
  \ despite the glut has also cut into prices.\"The fundamentals of oil are unlikely\
  \ to change in the first half of this year, which will see oil bedding down into\
  \ its bear market for months to come,\" IG´s Lucas said.Gold was at $1,203.59.40\
  \ an ounce, compared with $1,196.40 on Monday. (AFP)                        \r\n\
