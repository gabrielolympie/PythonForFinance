content: "Tokyo: The dollar struggled to recover Thursday after diving on comments\
  \ from the US Federal Reserve that cooled expectations of an early summer interest\
  \ rate hike.In Tokyo, the greenback briefly fell below 120 yen before ticking up\
  \ to 120.22 yen by midday, well down from 121.35 yen level in Tokyo before the US\
  \ central bank´s announcement. The euro changed hands at $1.0809 and 129.92 yen,\
  \ down from $1.0871 and 130.54 yen in New York but still well above $1.0595 and\
  \ 128.57 yen in Asia on Wednesday.While the US central bank opened the door for\
  \ a rise from six years of zero percent rates, it lowered its forecasts for economic\
  \ growth and inflation and stressed it would remain cautious before making any move.\"\
  It´s fair to say we now have somewhat stronger doubt that Fed rates ´lift-off´ will\
  \ begin a early as June, than we did heading into the FOMC (Federal Open Market\
  \ Committee)\" meeting, National Australia Bank said.\"The key takeaway is that\
  \ (Fed chief Janet) Yellen has successfully established in the market´s mind the\
  \ data, rather than date, dependency of Fed policy.\"After a two-day meeting, the\
  \ Fed on Wednesday issued a statement that removed a pledge to remain \"patient\"\
  \ on raising interest rates, signalling a possible mid-year rate increase.However\
  \ Yellen stressed growth prospects were more muted than three months ago, despite\
  \ strong increases in jobs creation. She noted consumer spending has slipped, inflation\
  \ has declined, wages are flat, and the stronger dollar has hurt US exports.The\
  \ policy committee lowered its rate outlook to 0.5-0.75 percent for the end of this\
  \ year from 1.0 percent previously, while also reducing its 2016 forecast to 1.75-2.5\
  \ percent from 2.5 percent. \"Just because we removed the word patient from the\
  \ statement doesn´t mean we´re going to be impatient,\" Yellen told reporters.Markets\
  \ have been focusing on the Fed´s timing for a rate hike -- a plus for the dollar\
  \ -- with Yellen´s comments giving much-needed relief for the euro, which has been\
  \ hammered by the European Central Bank´s new stimulus programme.While some analysts\
  \ pegged the dollar to fall further, loose monetary policy in major economies was\
  \ likely to stem its losses, said Sebastien Galy, a senior currency strategist at\
  \ Societe Generale.\"The dollar will resume its uptrend vs G10 in the next few weeks\
  \ driven by the pressure of negative interest rates elsewhere,\" he wrote in an\
  \ e-mail, according to Bloomberg News. (AFP)                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\
