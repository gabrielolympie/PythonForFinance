content: "BEIJING: Pakistan needs a \x93huge amount of financing\x94 for infrastructure\
  \ and energy projects and China is ready to announce help when President Xi Jinping\
  \ visits next week, a foreign ministry official said Friday.Islamabad has for decades\
  \ been Beijing´s closest ally in South Asia, and China -- which is expanding its\
  \ influence in the region -- is a major trading partner and key supplier of military\
  \ technology to Pakistan.Chinese assistant foreign minister Liu Jianchao declined\
  \ to offer details in a briefing to reporters ahead of Xi´s two-day trip, which\
  \ starts Monday, saying that the \"specific figure\" would be announced during the\
  \ visit.But he said a \"huge amount of financing\" was needed for projects in the\
  \ transport, infrastructure and energy fields that are part of a China-Pakistan\
  \ economic corridor initiative.\"China stands ready to provide financial support\
  \ for Pakistan to be used on these projects,\" Liu said.The Wall Street Journal\
  \ reported that Xi would announce a $46 billion spending plan for infrastructure,\
  \ with the largest share going for electricity generation.Xi was originally scheduled\
  \ to visit last September but Beijing cancelled the trip with Islamabad in the grip\
  \ of major anti-government street protests.China has been a key financial and military\
  \ ally of Islamabad over the years and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif secured\
  \ promises of $42 billion worth of investment when he went to Beijing in November\
  \ last year.Much of that centred on the energy sector -- Pakistan has wrestled with\
  \ chronic power shortages in recent years that have scrubbed several points off\
  \ GDP growth and inflicted misery on the everyday lives of its citizens.Pakistan´s\
  \ foreign ministry said Thursday that a number of important agreements and memorandums\
  \ of understanding would be signed during the visit, but gave no details.Liu said\
  \ Xi´s visit would be the first by a Chinese president in nine years and stressed\
  \ that it was his first overseas trip this year.\"It is yet another major diplomatic\
  \ action taken by China´s top leader in China´s neighbourhood,\" he said.He added\
  \ that the trip will \"map out an overall plan for China-Pakistan relations and\
  \ cooperation in various areas for the next five to 10 years and take bilateral\
  \ relations to a new level.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
