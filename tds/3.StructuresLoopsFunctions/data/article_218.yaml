content: "New York: The dollar weakened Tuesday after huge gains the prior week appeared\
  \ to encourage profit taking, while the euro benefited from Greece´s progress toward\
  \ a bailout.\"A lull in the US economic calendar over the first half of the week\
  \ has enticed many to cash in a few of the dollar´s big two percent gains from last\
  \ week which amounted to its best weekly performance in two months,\" said Joe Manimbo\
  \ at Western Union Business Solutions.The euro rose to $1.0942 around 2100 GMT from\
  \ $1.0824 at the same time Monday. The dollar also fell against the yen, to 123.86\
  \ from 124.30.The dollar´s weakness should be fleeting as the US Federal Reserve\
  \ readies an interest rate increase, said Kathy Lien of BK Asset Management, with\
  \ the next update of the Fed´s stance coming after a policy meeting on July 29.\"\
  Although the Fed is not expected to raise interest rates in July, the tone of the\
  \ monetary policy statement should be optimistic, reinforcing the notion that the\
  \ economy is ready for tightening,\" she said.Last week Fed chief Janet Yellen said\
  \ the rate hike was likely this year, underpinning the dollar´s rally. In Europe,\
  \ there was positive movement in Greece´s efforts to gain a new bailout. The Greek\
  \ government submitted to parliament a second batch of reform measures needed to\
  \ start negotiations, with a vote scheduled for Wednesday.\"The euro is higher as\
  \ progress continues to be made toward a third financial assistance program for\
  \ Greece,\" said Nick Bennenbroek, head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo Securities.\
