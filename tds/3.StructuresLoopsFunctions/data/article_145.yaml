  \ minister in Qatar warned OPEC members against cutting output unilaterally. Abdullah\
  \ al-Attiyah, who led the energy portfolio in oil-rich Qatar for about two decades,\
  \ said Monday that OPEC should first reach a binding agreement with non-members\
  \ before reducing production.\"OPEC should not do anything because it is not the\
  \ swing producer\" of the past, Attiyah told reporters in Kuwait City.\"They cannot\

  \ up of global crude reserves, which was a key reason for the collapse in prices\
  \ of more than 50 percent between June and January. Overall crude reserves in the\
  \ United States likely fell by 500,000 barrels in the week to May 8, according to\
  \ a survey of analysts by Bloomberg News. The US Energy Department will release\
  \ the official stockpiles figures on Wednesday. (AFP)                        \r\n\
