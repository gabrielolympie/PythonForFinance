content: "Hong Kong: Asian markets rallied and the euro held up Wednesday on hopes\
  \ of a settlement in Greece´s debt stand-off after it emerged that the country will\
  \ ask for an extension to its bailout and avoid a painful eurozone exit.Another\
  \ record close on Wall Street also provided support, although trade was thin with\
  \ some markets closed and others winding down for the Lunar New Year holiday.Tokyo\
  \ rose 0.84 percent, Hong Kong added 0.21 percent, Sydney put on 0.61 percent and\
  \ Singapore was 0.41 percent higher.Shanghai, Seoul and Taipei were closed for public\
  \ holidays.Greek public television said Tuesday that the new government will apply\
  \ for further aid from its European partners, although will not sign up to the painful\
  \ austerity measures imposed on the country.And in an interview with German public\
  \ broadcaster ZDF Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said: \"We should extend\
  \ the credit programme by a few months to have enough stability so that we can negotiate\
  \ a new agreement between Greece and Europe.\"The news will come as a relief after\
  \ two eurozone finance ministers´ meetings in the past week both collapsed without\
  \ agreement as Athens refused to continue with the bailout that imposed swingeing\
  \ spending cuts and tax hikes.The apparent change of face also comes days before\
  \ its financial lifeline package expires, which would leave the country without\
  \ any cash and unable to pay its bills, leading it to default and almost certainly\
  \ leave the eurozone.Investors bought up the euro on the reports and it held the\
  \ gains in Asia. The single currency fetched $1.1404 and 136.02 yen Wednesday, slightly\
  \ down from $1.1413 and 136.13 yen in New York afternoon but well above the $1.1357\
  \ and 134.70 yen quoted in Tokyo earlier Tuesday.The dollar fetched 119.29 yen from\
  \ 119.29 yen in New York and 118.55 yen in Tokyo on Tuesday.US shares resumed their\
  \ record-breaking run Tuesday after they were closed Monday for a public holiday.The\
  \ S&P 500 climbed 0.16 percent to a second straight all-time high, while the Dow\
  \ added 0.16 percent. The Nasdaq was up 0.11 percent.Oil prices, which have enjoyed\
  \ a small recovery over the past week, eased. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate\
  \ for March delivery fell 33 cents to $53.20 while Brent crude for April eased 20\
  \ cents to $62.33. Gold fetched $1,208.28 an ounce, against $1,220.88 on Tuesday.\
