content: "KARACHI: Pakistan on Tuesday received some $336 million from the United\
  \ States for its ongoing role in combating a Taliban insurgency in neighbouring\
  \ Afghanistan.The injection of cash, which comes as the Taliban steps up its annual\
  \ summer offensive launched in late April, has helped PakistanÂ´s foreign exchange\
  \ reserves reach a fresh high of about $19 billion, state bank officials said.Regular\
  \ payments to Pakistan under the Coalition Support Fund (CSF) programme began in\
  \ 2001 when Pakistan joined the US-led coalition in Afghanistan as a \"frontline\
  \ ally\".Pakistan provides use of its air bases and other facilities in exchange\
  \ for the reimbursements.The central State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) in a one-line\
  \ press note said it had received a total of $336.8 million under the CSF programme,\
  \ which is the first tranche of a $1.5 billion for the current fiscal year ending\
  \ June 2016.Pakistan has received a total of $13 billion in CSF payments since the\
  \ programme began.US-led NATO forces ended their combat mission in Afghanistan in\
  \ December, leaving local forces to battle militants alone, but a 13,000-strong\
  \ residual force remains for training and counter-terrorism operations.The Afghan\
  \ government meanwhile conducted its first face-to-face talks with Taliban cadres\
  \ on July 7 in a Pakistani hill station, aimed at ending the 14-year insurgency.But\
  \ despite the willingness to engage in talks there has been no let-up in militant\
  \ attacks, which are taking a heavy toll on civilians.Almost 1,000 civilians were\
  \ killed in the conflict during the first four months of this year, a sharp jump\
  \ from the same period last year, according to the United Nations.             \
