content: "SINGAPORE: Oil prices dropped on Tuesday after activity in China's factory\
  \ sector fell to an 11-month low and as Saudi Arabia said its production was close\
  \ to an all-time high.The flash HSBC/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dipped\
  \ to 49.2 in March, below the 50-point level that separates growth in activity from\
  \ a contraction on a monthly basis, stoking worries over the strength of the world's\
  \ No.2 economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 50.6.\"Considering\
  \ that the preliminary PMI figures for major crude importers turned out much lower\
  \ than estimates ... we expect both WTI and Brent to end-off today lower,\" Singapore-based\
  \ Phillip Futures said on Tuesday.The PMI drop in China followed an overnight report\
  \ that Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer, was now pumping around 10 million\
  \ barrels of crude oil per day, a near all-time high and some 350,000 bpd above\
  \ the figure Saudi Arabia gave to OPEC for its February output.\"The market was\
  \ under pressure early in the trading day after comments from Saudi Arabia that\
  \ it was producing almost 10 million barrels per day,\" ANZ bank said on Tuesday.Brent\
  \ crude oil futures were trading down 47 cents at $55.45 a barrel at 0750 GMT. U.S.\
  \ WTI crude dropped 65 cents to $46.80 a barrel.Worries over slowing growth in China's\
  \ economy as well as high production have contributed to a global surplus in oil\
  \ supplies.\"We expect crude prices to be pressured once again by the weight of\
  \ some 2 million barrels per day of oversupply in Q2 2015,\" energy consultancy\
  \ FGE said in a note on Tuesday.The refinery sector has benefited from cheap oil,\
  \ which has improved margins for oil products such as diesel or jet fuel.\"A sharp\
  \ decline in crude prices over late 2014 and into January 2015, followed by an extraordinarily\
  \ cold February (in the United States and parts of Europe), has meant good times\
  \ for refiners,\" FGE said, but it added that high refinery margins were unlikely\
  \ to last.\"In H2 2015, we see an oversupplied products market even as crude prices\
  \ begin to recover. Refinery margins will adjust downwards.\"                  \
