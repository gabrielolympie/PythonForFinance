  \ in Pakistan has increased by about Rs 2000 per tonne to reach Rs 37400 per tonne.A\
  \ rise in global crude oil prices has affected the otherwise consistently falling\
  \ price of furnace oil. According to experts, the constant falling price of furnace\
  \ oil during October to December last year attributed to the reduction of cost of\
  \ electricity production by Rs 3. The relief is being passed on to consumers gradually\
  \ by the government. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
