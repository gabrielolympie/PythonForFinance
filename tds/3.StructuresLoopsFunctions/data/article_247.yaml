content: "LONDON: Global oil prices hit a new six and a half year low Thursday, nearing\
  \ the key $40 a barrel level as a surprise rise in US stocks fuelled supply glut\
  \ fears.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for September delivery sank to $40.21\
  \ per barrel, the lowest level since March 2009. It later stood at $40.30, down\
  \ 50 cents from Wednesday´s close.Brent North Sea crude for October delivery meanwhile\
  \ slid to $46.31 a barrel, a point last seen in mid-January and not far off a six-year\
  \ nadir. The contract later stood at $46.40, down 76 cents.\"US stockpiles unexpectedly\
  \ expanded when the market was looking at a contraction, which heightened the global\
  \ oversupply concerns,\" said Bernard Aw, a market strategist at IG Markets.\"This\
  \ added pressure to crude prices, and we see WTI drop below $41, heading towards\
  \ the key $40 level. We could see more downsides, given that the current conditions\
  \ remain unfavourable to oil.\"The US Department of Energy on Wednesday said oil\
  \ stockpiles rose 2.6 million barrels in the week ending August 14, and reported\
  \ a 300,000 barrel rise at the closely watched Cushing, Oklahoma trading hub.The\
  \ surprise jump in inventories at a time when they normally fall added to concerns\
  \ of a global surplus, particularly as signs emerge that demand is faltering in\
  \ top energy importer China.US banking giant Citigroup said WTI could fall to $32\
  \ a barrel, a level not seen since the throes of the financial crisis, pressured\
  \ by excess supplies.\"Oil balances point to further oversupply throughout 2015\
  \ begging the question how low can oil go,\" it said in a market commentary, adding\
  \ that hitting the 2008 low of $32.40 a barrel \"is a conceivable reality.\"But\
  \ Daniel Ang, an investment analyst with Phillip Futures in Singapore, said he expects\
  \ WTI to be supported at $40 a barrel in Thursday´s trading session.\"Technically,\
  \ we are still seeing a very bearish momentum, however for prices to break below\
  \ $40 is going to be an arduous task,\" he said.\"We see $40 for WTI to be a strong\
  \ psychological support.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
