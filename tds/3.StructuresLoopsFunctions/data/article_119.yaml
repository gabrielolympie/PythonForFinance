content: "Hong Kong: Japanese shares hit a 15-year high Wednesday after the country\
  \ recorded its first trade surplus in three years, while the euro weakened on growing\
  \ concerns that Greece will not reach a bailout reform deal with its creditors.With\
  \ few catalysts to spur business in Asia, other markets were mostly higher despite\
  \ a broadly negative lead from Wall Street.Tokyo rallied 1.11 percent, Hong Kong\
  \ gained 0.12 percent and Shanghai put on 0.26 percent while Seoul added 0.72 percent.\
  \ Sydney slipped 0.58 percent.Tokyo´s Nikkei broke back through the 20,000 point\
  \ barrier -- after briefly clearing the hurdle earlier this month -- as the yen\
  \ slipped against the dollar.Before the market opened the finance ministry said\
  \ March saw the country enjoy its first trade surplus since June 2012 thanks to\
  \ tumbling oil prices and a boost in exports.However, economists warned the positive\
  \ results might not last.\"We expect the yen to weaken further in coming months,\
  \ which should lift the cost of imports by more than the yen-value of exports,\"\
  \ Marcel Thieliant at Capital Economics wrote in a commentary.\"The trade balance\
  \ is unlikely to remain in surplus for long.\"The dollar was at 119.68 yen against\
  \ 119.63 yen in New York and well up from 119.44 yen in Tokyo earlier Tuesday.The\
  \ dollar´s strength comes despite the diminishing likelihood of a US rate hike by\
  \ the US Federal Reserve soon.\"More and more the expectation is that the Fed won´t\
  \ do anything soon. The momentum in equities is still there,\" Evan Lucas, a markets\
  \ strategist at IG in Melbourne, told Bloomberg News.The euro slipped as investors\
  \ nervously follow events in Europe as Greece struggles to scrape cash together\
  \ to pay its bills.Athens is facing a backlash from the country´s mayors after it\
  \ issued a decree ordering them to hand over their reserves in order to service\
  \ its debts and pay wages.The government is locked in negotiations with its international\
  \ creditors on unlocking some billions of euros in much-needed bailout funds. Failure\
  \ to secure the cash will likely see it default and possibly crash out of the eurozone,\
  \ which analysts fear could have global repercussions.Greece´s creditors sounded\
  \ the alarm Saturday over the pace of debt negotiations, with European Central Bank\
  \ chief Mario Draghi saying: \"More work, much more work is needed now, and it´s\
  \ urgent.\"The euro slipped to $1.0721 and 128.33 yen from $1.0735 and 128.42 yen\
  \ in US trade.On Wall Street the Dow fell 0.47 percent and the S&P 500 slipped 0.15\
  \ percent but the Nasdaq added 0.39 percent.The next focus for investors is the\
  \ release Thursday of HSBC´s preliminary report on activity in China´s manufacturing\
  \ sector, which will give the latest indication about the state of the world´s number\
  \ two economy.Oil prices were lower. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for May\
