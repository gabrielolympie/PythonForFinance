content: "ISLAMABAD: Moody's Investor Service has upgraded Pakistan\x92s sovereign\
  \ credit rating by a notch, from Caa1 to B3, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar announced\
  \ on Thursday in the National Assembly.According to Dar, Moody's had downgraded\
  \ the country\x92s credit rating to Caa1 on July 13, 2012.The outlook for the rating\
  \ back then was negative. A sovereign with a Caa rating is judged to be of poor\
  \ standing and subject to very high credit risk.Weak government finances, structural\
  \ inflationary pressures and domestic political uncertainties were adding to Pakistan's\
  \ external vulnerabilities and debt sustainability, thereby compounding the downward\
  \ pressure on sovereign creditworthiness, Moody\x92s said.Moody's also said the\
  \ downgrade was also prompted by an upcoming repayment of $7.5 billion to the International\
  \ Monetary Fund. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
