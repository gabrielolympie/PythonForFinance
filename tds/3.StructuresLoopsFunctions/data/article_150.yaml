  \ a three-day visit with a promise of $50 billion in investment for creaking infrastructure\
  \ as his hosts finalize preparations for next year´s Rio Olympics.Li, who was due\
  \ to land late afternoon in the capital Brasilia, will hold talks Tuesday with President\
  \ Dilma Rousseff, for whom the investment will be a major boon. Brazil´s economy\
  \ is battling a fifth straight year of poor growth and spiraling inflation. Li will\
  \ head for Rio on Tuesday evening to see some of China´s investment in the city,\
  \ which Brasilia supplanted as the capital in 1960 but which will in August next\
  \ year welcome South America´s first ever Olympic Games.On Thursday, Li will continue\
  \ a Latin American swing designed to increase Chinese influence in the region, heading\
  \ to Colombia before visiting Peru and Chile.Chinese investment in Brazil has grown\
  \ exponentially over the past decade, with the Asian giant becoming Brazil´s main\
  \ trading partner in 2009.Trade between China and Latin America as a whole rose\
  \ some 2,550 percent between 2000 and 2012 from barely $10 billion to $255.5 billion.Boom\
  \ in Sino-Brazilian tradeSino-Brazilian trade mushroomed from $6.5 billion in 2003\
  \ to $83.3 billion in 2012.Jose Graca Lima, head of Asian affairs in the Brazilian\
  \ foreign ministry, said ahead of Li´s arrival that a \"second generation\" of Chinese\
  \ investment is under way. The first involved trade in raw materials and the focus\
  \ now is on heavy industry and infrastructure, he said.Graca Lima said Friday that\
  \ Rousseff and Li will ink a series of accords on political and commercial issues,\
  \ and some 30 investment deals. One mooted project is a proposed rail link stretching\
  \ some 3,500 kilometers (2,175 miles) from the key Brazilian port of Santos to the\
  \ Peruvian Pacific port of Ilo.Graca Lima said the plan would take some three to\
  \ four years to realize, but he assured it is \"advancing,\" despite some environmental\
  \ groups voicing concern.The countries are also expected to announce the delivery\
  \ of 22 jetliners from Brazil´s Embraer to China -- part of a larger order of 60\
  \ airplanes from the world´s number three commercial aircraft developer.Brazil has\
  \ seen its reputation hit by a huge graft scandal at oil giant Petrobras. But the\
  \ firm received a boost earlier this year when it signed a $3.5 billion financing\
  \ deal with the China Investment Bank.\"China is fulfilling a desperately-needed\
  \ role of investor in Latin America and the Caribbean -- Brazil desperately needs\
  \ investment,\" says Charles Tang, chairman of the Rio-based Brazil-China Chamber\
  \ of Commerce and Industry.\"The US back yard is growing a Chinese back garden -\
  \ not just in Brazil but all over Latin America.\"\"We believe in the fundamentals\
  \ of Brazil,\" Tang told AFP.\"China sees opportunities in Brazil for investment\
  \ and also has the funds available to invest\" for strategic and geopolitical reasons.In\
  \ an interview, Tang referred to a World Policy Institute essay he penned in 2013\
  \ in which he said \"Latin America and China´s economies are complementary. Brazil\
  \ ... has insufficient savings to finance increases in export production and job\
  \ creation or build the infrastructure it needs.\"China has abundant capital --\
  \ but needs the plentiful strategic resources that Brazil has.\"Li´s visit will\
  \ feature trade delegations some 130-strong from both countries during his Brasilia\
  \ stay. In Rio, he will attend the unveiling of Chinese-made trains for a new Metro\
  \ line.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
