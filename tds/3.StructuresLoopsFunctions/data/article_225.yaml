content: "WASHINGTON: Microsoft began rolling out its Windows 10 operating system\
  \ Wednesday, aiming to revive the tech giant´s fortunes, especially in mobile and\
  \ the \"Internet of Things.\"The stakes are high for Microsoft as it pushes out\
  \ the new operating system for both traditional computers and mobile devices such\
  \ as tablets and smartphones.The US tech giant is hoping the new system can help\
  \ it gain traction in mobile, where it lags behind Google Android and Apple iOS.\"\
  Our vision was one platform, one store, and one experience that extends across the\
  \ broadest range of devices from the smallest screens to the largest screens to\
  \ no screens at all,\" said Microsoft executive vice president for Windows Terry\
  \ Myerson in a blog post.\"Windows 10 begins to deliver on our vision for more personal\
  \ computing. In this world experiences are mobile, moving with you seamlessly and\
  \ easily across your devices. Interacting with technology is as natural as interacting\
  \ with people -- using voice, pen, gestures and even gaze for the right interaction,\
  \ in the right way, at the right time. And in our connected and transparent world,\
  \ we respect your privacy and help protect your information.\"Forrester Research\
  \ analyst Frank Gillett said Microsoft faces a tough task in catching up with Google\
  \ and Apple in the mobile space.\"Microsoft will face a long road ahead to gain\
  \ Windows share in mobile,\" he said.\"While it will win a growing share of enterprise\
  \ tablet purchases, the plans for Windows 10 don´t show enough potential to create\
  \ a differentiated mobile experience that will draw developers and customers away\
  \ from iOS and Android.\"Richard Edwards, analyst at the consultancy Ovum, said\
  \ Microsoft is looking beyond mobile to emerging technologies including wearables\
  \ and other connected devices.\"This isn´t about recapturing the important mobile\
  \ operating systems market,\" Edwards said.\"It´s about gaining a strong foothold\
  \ in the next multibillion dollar market: the ´Internet of Things.´\"- Skipping\
  \ to Windows 10 -Windows 10 -- Microsoft skipped directly from Windows 8, which\
  \ got a lackluster response -- is being offered as a free upgrade for most devices,\
  \ making it possible to be available quickly on billions of devices.It will allow\
  \ for voice, pen and gesture input, and in some cases biometric identification for\
  \ improved security.The Cortana virtual assistant -- Microsoft´s answer to Apple´s\
  \ Siri and Google Now -- will also be integrated.And Windows 10 will include the\
  \ Microsoft Edge browser, a move designed to help the tech giant regain market share\
  \ lost to rivals such as Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.Microsoft hopes to break\
  \ the cycle in which consumers shun Windows for mobile because it lacks the large\
  \ catalog of applications found on rival platforms, thus discouraging app makers\
  \ from creating Windows versions.Hit apps could ramp up popularity of Windows-driven\
  \ hardware made by Microsoft and its partners, and increase opportunities for the\
  \ company to make money from online activities such as search, shopping and software\
  \ as services in the Internet cloud.With Windows 10 and other products, Microsoft\
  \ is shifting away from one-time software sales to a subscription model -- or software\
  \ as a service -- in an effort to better compete in the new tech landscape.Bob O´Donnell\
  \ at the research firm Technalysis said the new operating system may help stimulate\
  \ new sales of computers and other hardware -- a phenomenon of the past which has\
  \ been absent in recent Windows releases.\"I´m still hopeful that the PC industry\
  \ will see some decent upside from Windows 10, particularly in the fourth quarter\
  \ of this year and into 2016,\" he said.\"The primary reason for my optimism is\
  \ that Microsoft has actually integrated quite a few new capabilities into Windows\
  \ 10 that will benefit from new hardware.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
