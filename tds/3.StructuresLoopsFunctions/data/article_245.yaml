content: "WASHINGTON: BuzzFeed, the website which lives off viral and \"shareable\"\
  \ news, got a major boost for expansion plans Tuesday with a $200 million investment\
  \ from NBCUniversal.The deal with NBCU, a division of the media and cable conglomerate\
  \ Comcast, calls for \"strategic partnerships\" between the two groups, which could\
  \ allow sharing of content between BuzzFeed and the vast NBC television operations.The\
  \ deal values the \"social news\" pioneer at some $1.5 billion, according to several\
  \ media reports. The companies did not comment on the valuation terms of the investment.\"\
  It´s a fascinating time for the media industry; social, mobile, digital, and broadcast\
  \ platforms are converging to create new opportunities to connect with global audiences,\"\
  \ said Jonah Peretti, BuzzFeed´s founder and chief executive.The news comes just\
  \ a week after NBCUniversal announced a similar $200 million injection into another\
  \ digital news group, Vox Media, and highlights the potential seen in online news\
  \ as consumers move away from traditional media.\"BuzzFeed has built an exceptional\
  \ global company that harmonizes technology, data and superior editorial abilities\
  \ to create and share content in innovative ways,\" said Steve Burke, CEO at NBCUniversal.\"\
  They reach a massive, loyal audience and have proven to be among the most creative,\
  \ popular and influential new media players. We are pleased to be making this investment\
  \ and for our companies to partner and work together.\"The investment follows Monday´s\
  \ announcement that BuzzFeed would launch a Japanese news website in a partnership\
  \ with Yahoo Japan, the latest step in a global expansion push.BuzzFeed is one of\
  \ the largest pure-play digital websites, claiming to reach some 200 million users\
  \ worldwide.With its recent expansion, the group says some 45 percent of traffic\
  \ now comes from outside the United States, having launched editions in Britain,\
  \ Brazil, France, Australia, India, Germany, Mexico and Canada.BuzzFeed, founded\
  \ in 2006 by Huffington Post co-founder Peretti, was known for offbeat \"shareable\"\
  \ news but has been investing in new staff and technology as it expands globally.NBCU\
  \ was created as a joint venture with the NBC broadcast group and Universal Pictures,\
  \ previously controlled by France´s Vivendi. Comcast took full control of NBCU in\
  \ 2013.- Profiting from sharing -While BuzzFeed´s finances are not made public,\
  \ documents leaked last week by the website Gawker suggested it is making a profit\
  \ -- some $2.7 million in the first six months of 2014 and $7 million in 2013.Rebecca\
  \ Lieb, an independent media consultant and analyst, said BuzzFeed \"has successfully\
  \ captured mass eyeballs, which is difficult in an era of highly specialised and\
  \ topical information.\"BuzzFeed \"is good at picking topics which are light and\
  \ entertaining and shareable,\" Lieb told AFP.Additionally, she said BuzzFeed has\
  \ successfully reached younger audiences who often don´t read newspapers or subscribe\
  \ to cable television, and that this group is attractive to advertisers.BuzzFeed\
  \ also has been able to optimise its content by using algorithms that show which\
  \ stories are viewed and shared most often, and prioritising these items, Lieb said.She\
  \ added that the website is strong in \"native\" advertising, which includes \"\
  sponsored\" and similar content.The tie-up with NBCU offers potential, Lieb said,\
  \ such as snippets of Olympic videos which could be offered to BuzzFeed and drive\
  \ consumers to watch more on television.Kenneth Lerer, BuzzFeed´s executive chairman,\
  \ said in a statement that the tie-up could mean \"collaborating on television content,\
  \ movies, the Olympics, and joint partnerships with ad agencies and brands.\"Last\
  \ year, BuzzFeed said it had secured $50 million in a deal that reportedly valued\
  \ it at $850 million. But the latest injection vaults it into the club of \"unicorns,\"\
  \ a term used for startups valued at over $1 billion.Vox is believed to be worth\
  \ over $1 billion following its recent cash infusion from NBCU. And Vice Media last\
  \ year secured some $500 million which boosted its valuation to a reported $2.5\
  \ billion.One of the largest digital-only news groups is the Huffington Post, whose\
  \ future is uncertain after its parent company AOL was sold this year to telecom\
  \ giant Verizon. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
