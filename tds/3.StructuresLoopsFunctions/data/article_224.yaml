content: "Hong Kong: Asian markets tumbled further Tuesday, dragged down by another\
  \ massive sell-off in Shanghai a day after the mainland Chinese market´s heaviest\
  \ one-day losses in more than eight years.Fears of a resumption of the rout that\
  \ strafed Chinese shares over a month until July 8 sent global traders running Monday,\
  \ with Wall Street falling for a fifth day in a row and safe-haven gold edging back\
  \ up after a recent slip.The dollar weakened against the yen on risk-aversion while\
  \ analysts said the latest crisis on Chinese markets could affect Federal Reserve\
  \ policymakers´ decision when considering hiking interest rates.Shanghai, which\
  \ collapsed 8.48 percent Monday, fell a further four percent Tuesday, while Hong\
  \ Kong was 0.50 percent down. Tokyo shed 1.07 percent, Sydney was 0.89 percent lower\
  \ and Seoul retreated 0.83 percent.Chinese investors rushed for the exit Monday\
  \ as more data showing the economy still struggling mixed with fears that government\
  \ measures to prevent a market crash -- including providing vast sums of cash to\
  \ support shares -- will not last.The moves -- introduced after a more than 30 percent\
  \ dive that wiped trillions off valuations in just under four weeks -- had been\
  \ credited with helping to stem the bleeding, stabilise trading and put prices back\
  \ on an upward trajectory. The market had surged more than 150 percent in the year\
  \ to hitting a near-term peak on June 12.Tuesday´s losses came despite assurances\
  \ from Beijing that it will unleash more cash to provide stability to jittery share\
  \ markets.State-backed China Securities Finance Corporation (CSFC), which has reportedly\
  \ already pumped billions of yuan into mainland equities under a government plan,\
  \ will continue to buy stocks, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. - Return\
  \ of volatility -\"The worst time has passed but we think there is a final leg for\
  \ this correction,\" Steve Yang, strategist at UBS Group AG, said. \"Fundamentally\
  \ there is no reason for funds to come in and buy aggressively.\"However, Zhang\
  \ Yanbing, an analyst at Zheshang Securities, told AFP: \"It´s a normal correction\
  \ of the market since it rose too much before.\"Shares had climbed about 17 percent\
  \ since hitting a trough on July 8.Analysts said the events could be a key issue\
  \ on the agenda when the Fed´s policy meeting takes place this week. While it is\
  \ not expected to lift interest rates now, dealers are hoping for some guidance\
  \ on its plans.\"The return of market volatility in China will be a significant\
  \ discussion point at the US Fed in terms of what this is telling us about the Chinese\
  \ economy,\" Matthew Sherwood, Sydney-based head of investment strategy at Perpetual\
  \ Ltd., said. \"There is a lot of global weakness and significant external risk.\"\
  The dollar eased to 123.19 yen early Tuesday, from 123.24 yen in New York and well\
  \ off the 123.75 yen earlier in Asia.The euro changed hands at $1.1089 and 136.68\
  \ yen against $1.1091 and 136.69 yen in US trade.Gold, which is considered a safe\
  \ bet in times of crisis, fetched $1.095.66 an ounce compared with $1.096.60 late\
  \ Monday but it is much higher than the $1,080.50 at the end of last week.Oil prices\
  \ continue to suffer from fears about the global economy as well as an oversupply\
  \ of the commodity. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for September delivery\
  \ was down 30 cents to $47.09 and Brent crude for September dropped 40 cents to\
  \ $53.07. (AFP)                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
