content: "KUWAIT CITY: Foreigners working in the energy-rich Arab states of the Gulf\
  \ sent more than $100 billion in remittances to their home countries last year,\
  \ an economic report showed Tuesday.The figure was twice as high as remittances\
  \ in 2010, an indication of strong growth, the head of economic research at Kuwait\
  \ Financial Center (Markaz), Raghu Mandagoathur, said in the report.Around 25 million\
  \ expats live in the Gulf Cooperation Council states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,\
  \ Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- equal to the native population.The\
  \ remittances are estimated at 6.2 percent of the combined GDP of the six GCC states\
  \ of $1.6 trillion, the report said, citing IMF and World Bank figures.In comparison,\
  \ foreigners in the United States and Britain sent home just 0.7 percent and 0.8\
  \ percent of GDP, respectively, it said.Saudi Arabia topped the list with its estimated\
  \ 10 million expats sending home $44 billion, followed by UAE with 29 billion.Remittances\
  \ from Kuwait and Qatar were $12 billion and $9.5 billion, respectively, while smaller\
  \ transfers were made out of Oman and Bahrain, the report said.The majority of Gulf\
  \ expatriates originate from India, Egypt, the Philippines, Bangladesh and Pakistan,\
  \ as well as Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Yemen.The report attributed the high level\
  \ of remittances to curbs applied by GCC states on foreign ownership and investment.And\
  \ unlike in Western countries, foreigners have no hope of acquiring citizenship\
  \ in GCC states regardless of the duration of residence.The report advised GCC states\
  \ to encourage expatriates to invest by launching specialised services and opening\
  \ up their markets to foreign residents, especially the real estate sector.    \
