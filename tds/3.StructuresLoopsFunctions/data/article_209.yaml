  \ in negotiations on Iran´s nuclear program, Greece´s tough bailout agreement with\
  \ its European creditors and a mixed OPEC report.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate\
  \ (WTI) for August delivery closed at $52.20 a barrel in New York trade, down 54\
  \ cents from Friday´s settlement.Brent North Sea crude for August shed 88 cents\
  \ at $57.86 in London.\"The crude oil market is on the defensive in Monday trade\
  \ as investors sort through the headlines since Friday,\" said Tim Evans of Citi\
  \ Futures.Marathon talks between six major powers and Iran over Tehran´s nuclear\
  \ program were making \"real progress\" but issues remained, the United States said\
  \ Monday, suggesting the Vienna talks would stretch into another day.A deal could\
  \ result in the lifting of sanctions that have sharply curbed Iran´s oil exports.The\
  \ oil market is \"wary that an Iranian nuclear deal could mean more supply, although\
  \ it won´t be right away,\" said Evans.Greece´s bailout deal meanwhile lifted the\
  \ dollar, which makes dollar-priced crude oil less attractive to buyers using other\
  \ currencies.\"Oil traders are more concerned that the euro is weaker and the dollar\
  \ stronger on the news,\" said Evans.Meanwhile, in its July monthly report, OPEC\
  \ raised its forecast for growth in crude demand this year by 100,000 barrels to\
  \ 1.28 million barrels per day.In 2016, demand is expected to pick up by 1.34 million\
  \ barrels per day, hitting 93.94 million barrels per day, thanks to stronger economic\
  \ growth, according to the OPEC report.\"OPEC raised its demand forecast... but\
  \ with the stout supply picture, the market still has a bearish sentiment to price,\"\
  \ said Brian Swan, commodity analyst at Schneider Electric.                    \
