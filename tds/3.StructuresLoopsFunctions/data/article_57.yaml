content: "New York: New York oil prices fell in late trade Friday, with the WTI contract\
  \ breaking away from a stable trade in London to fall near the $50 dollar line.West\
  \ Texas Intermediate for March delivery settled at the official close at $50.32\
  \ a barrel, down 82 cents from Thursday, as the contract expired. WTI then continued\
  \ to fall further in late trade, dropping below $50.In London, Brent crude for April\
  \ delivery was flat at $60.22 a barrel, one cent higher from a day earlier.US and\
  \ Canadian output continued to rise despite the weak market, adding to the gap between\
  \ the two key benchmarks.\"Still-rising US production and climbing inventories remain\
  \ the more relevant fundamental story,\" said Timothy Evans of Citi Futures.Analysts\
  \ at JPMorgan said reports of production and export drops in the Middle East and\
  \ North Africa helped hold up London prices.\"An additional support also comes from\
  \ higher crude demand in Europe from strong refinery margins and US refinery maintenance\
  \ allowing refiners elsewhere to fill the product supply gap,\" they said.\"We continue\
  \ to expect that crude markets will come under pressure in the short term, however,\
  \ fundamentals point to stress on Brent-related crude outweighing that on WTI.\"\
  More broadly, they said they foresee overall demand will decline as refineries adjust\
  \ to different conditions, further pressing downward on prices.\"Assuming that Brent\
  \ markets witness a reversal of the supply losses that have tightened them significantly\
  \ in recent weeks, then we would expect weaker Brent cash differentials and structure\
  \ to erode the support for Brent crude against other benchmarks, notably WTI.\"\
