  \ as of March 2015 as compared to 1.95 per cent at end of corresponding period last\
  \ year.  This enormous jump in broadband penetration can be attributed to Next Generation\
  \ Mobile Services (NGMS) spectrum auction as mobile broadband leads the way in total\
  \ broadband subscriber base.  As evident from the figure an immediate spike in broadband\
  \ penetration can be observed in quarter after commercial launch of NGMS in the\
  \ country. It is expected that mobile broadband will continue to form major chunk\
  \ of broadband market and may also prove to be a catalyst for other broadband technologies\
  \ to prosper in future. Official sources on Tuesday said Pakistan Telecommunication\
  \ Authority (PTA) conducts nationwide broadband Quality of Service (QoS) survey\
  \ in metropolitan cities and performance of different packages offered by operators\
  \ was measured in different times.  During the survey three months data of non technical\
  \ parameters i.e. response time of assistance service billing and service provisioning\
  \ complaint resolution time were also analysed. The survey results analysis revealed\
  \ that by and large QoS performance of broadband service providers can be rated\
  \ as good.                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
