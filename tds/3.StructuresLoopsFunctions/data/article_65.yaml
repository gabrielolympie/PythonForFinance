  \ his country was preparing to export sizeable quantity of electricity to Pakistan\
  \ to lessen the intensity of the energy crisis which has compromised economic growth.\
  \ The KASA 1000 project is among the major electricity transfer projects in the\
  \ region, based on which 1,300 megawatts of electricity from Kazakhstan and Tajikistan\
  \ is expected to be transferred to Afghanistan and Pakistan.He said that Tajikistan\
  \ wished to enhance bilateral trade with Pakistan and invited the business community\
  \ to visit his country to explore investment opportunities and organise trade exhibitions.\
  \ He added that the energy sector of Tajikistan had been showing sustainable growth\
  \ for the last 15 years transforming the country into the world\x92s third largest\
  \ producer of hydroelectric power after the US and Russia. Jononov went on to say\
  \ that hydroelectric generation accounted for 76 percent of the total energy output\
  \ of the country and the total cost of the project which would lighten Pakistan\
  \ through Tajik electricity will be financed by the World Bank, ADB, Islamic Development\
  \ Bank and other donors.He also said that this project would not only alleviate\
  \ electricity shortages in Pakistan but would also replace fuel based electricity\
  \ generation for Afghanistan and Pakistan, adding that it would also establish Afghanistan\
  \ as a viable transit country and offer transmission capacity for other countries\
  \ during the off peak season.He further said that it would also create a viable\
  \ governance mechanism to build confidence among neighbours as major share of the\
  \ export will be used by Pakistan and approximately 300 MW will be utilised by Afghanistan.\
