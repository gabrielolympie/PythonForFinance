content: "SINGAPORE: Oil futures climbed more than $1 a barrel on Monday, after Saudi\
  \ Arabia raised prices for crude sales to Asia for a second month, signalling better\
  \ demand in the region.International benchmark Brent regained ground after tumbling\
  \ as much as 5 percent on Thursday, when a preliminary nuclear deal was finally\
  \ reached between world powers and Iran. More Iranian oil could enter global markets\
  \ if that is followed by a comprehensive deal by June.But analysts warned a ramp-up\
  \ in exports could take months and would likely not happen before 2016.\"While clearly\
  \ a bearish headline, a final deal and full lifting of sanctions still faces a number\
  \ of obstacles,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note.\"Even if a final deal\
  \ is reached, we do not expect any physical market impact before 2016,\" the analysts\
  \ said.Brent crude for May delivery touched a high of $56.19 a barrel and was up\
  \ $1.19 from Thursday at $56.14 by 0635 GMT. US crude for May delivery was $1.21\
  \ higher at $50.35 a barrel, after earlier touching $50.48.There was no settlement\
  \ in either Brent or US crude futures on Friday as markets were closed for the start\
  \ of the Easter holiday.Despite the sanctions on Iran, China's imports from the\
  \ OPEC producer are set to rise from August as a Chinese state trader has signed\
  \ a deal with the National Iranian Oil Company to buy more condensate.The world's\
  \ top exporter Saudi Arabia kept output steady and cut its official selling prices\
  \ (OSPs) sharply late last year in a fight for market share during a global supply\
  \ glut.Its ability to raise prices for April and May suggests its strategy is working,\
  \ although competition has kept its flagship Arab Light at a discount to Oman/Dubai\
  \ quotes, analysts said.\"There is still competition for the Asia market even though\
  \ it is also a sign that some of the production elsewhere is less able to compete\
  \ in the market right now,\" said Shunling Yap, a senior oil and gas analyst at\
  \ BMI Research.On the supply front, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United\
  \ States declined by 11 last week to 802, the smallest drop since December, a weekly\
  \ survey by oil service firm Baker Hughes showed on Thursday.Two weeks of small\
  \ declines in the US rig count have raised expectations that drilling activity is\
  \ nearing a level that could dent output, bolster prices and coax rigs back to the\
  \ field after a precipitous cull since October.                        \r\n\r\n\r\
