content: "London: Oil prices rebounded slightly Tuesday after recent sharp losses\
  \ caused by an oversupplied market.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for\
  \ April delivery rose 39 cents to $49.84 a barrel.Brent North Sea crude for April\
  \ climbed 51 cents to stand at $59.41 a barrel in London afternoon deals.WTI shed\
  \ $1.36 in New York and Brent lost $1.32 on Monday, building on heavy losses last\
  \ Friday, as US crude stockpiles linger at historic levels, contributing to a global\
  \ oversupply.A closely watched report on US weekly crude stockpiles is next due\
  \ on Wednesday, with a Bloomberg News survey saying inventories are expected to\
  \ have risen by 3.75 million barrels.US oil stockpiles are already at their highest\
  \ level on record at this time of year.\"The expectation of further rising US crude\
  \ oil stocks is pressuring prices,\" said Commerzbank analysts in a note to clients.Globally,\
  \ crude supplies are also being boosted after oilfields in eastern Libya resumed\
  \ pumping to the port of Hariga after a pipeline was repaired, and oil producer\
  \ Oman plans to ramp up output to 980,000 barrels a day this year.\"The partial\
  \ return of supply from Libya is weighing on the Brent price despite its sustainability\
  \ being anything but certain,\" said Commerzbank.Crude prices lost about 60 percent\
  \ of their value to about $40 between June and late January owing to an oversupply\
  \ in world markets, a weak global economy and a strong dollar.Prices have risen\
  \ above multi-year lows following a slowdown in US oil drilling activities, but\
  \ analysts say volatility is likely to continue for some time.\"It is apparent by\
  \ now that drilling in the US will slow, global production growth is expected to\
  \ be lower, and demand, at least in the US, is reacting positively to lower prices,\"\
  \ British bank Barclays said in a report.\"In short, the market is forecast to remain\
  \ oversupplied for most of 2015, but expectations beyond that are for more balanced\
  \ fundamentals.\" (AFP)                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
