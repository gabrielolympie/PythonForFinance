content: "ISLAMABAD: Following its approval from National Assembly, the lower house\
  \ of the parliament, the upper house Senate on Wednesday also passed the Gas Infrastructure\
  \ Development Cess (GIDC) bill 2015 amid protest from some opposition members.During\
  \ the discussion, members of opposition parties criticized the government for presenting\
  \ the bill in the house and urged that it should be presented in Council of Common\
  \ Interest (CCI) for consultation with the provinces before its passage. Senator\
  \ Tahir Hussain Mashhadi of MQM said that the the bill should have been presented\
  \ in the CCI. He said any tax on natural resources cannot be imposed without consultation\
  \ of provinces, he said.Senator Nauman Wazir and Sentor Saleem Mandviwala called\
  \ for need to find a mechansim of gas infrastructure development and suggested that\
  \ concerns of opposition should also be addressed.Opposition Leader Aitzaz Ahsan\
  \ and Senators including Usman Saifullah, Mohsin Aziz, Shahi Syed, Saeed Ghani,\
  \ Usman Kakar, Sassui Paleejo, Robina Adnan, Naseema Ehsan and Mohsin Leghari registered\
  \ their opposing comments on the bill during discussion.Opposition members belonging\
  \ to Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Awami National\
  \ Party (ANP) and Balochistan National Awami Party staged a token walk out from\
  \ the House.Earlier, Minister for Petroleum and Natural Resources Shahid Khaqan\
  \ Abbasi in his winding up speech said National Assembly has already passed the\
  \ Bill and said the government requires Rs1000 billion annually to maintain and\
  \ improve gas infrastructure in the country.He said that Rs100 billion would be\
  \ collated annually through this levy and it would be used for gas infrastructure\
  \ and added that no province is self-sufficient in gas.He said that the production\
  \ of gas is 4 BCFD and demand is 8 BCFD adding that it is very necessary to fund\
  \ some important projects.He said that TAPI is Rs1 trillion project but our share\
  \ is of Rs100 billion.The minister said that the collection amount of GIDC would\
  \ not be misused and the parliament would oversee it.Shahid Khaqan said that the\
  \ CCI itself says that the GIDC does not come into its domain and federal government\
  \ should settle it. He said that Supreme Court has already decided that it is not\
  \ a tax but a cess.Defending further the Cess Bill, he argued that to bridge the\
  \ widening gas supply gap a number of gas import projects were being perused including\
  \ the Iran-Pakistan (IP) gas pipeline project, Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India\
  \ (TAPI) pipeline project, LNG import projects and LPG supply enhancement project\
  \ in public as well as private sectors.He said that in case the required infrastructure\
  \ was not developed for the above mentioned projects the government would be forced\
  \ to import liquefied fuels which are much costlier as compared to gas.Further Pakistan\
  \ would also be exposed to payment of liquidated damages or payments. According\
  \ to him presently neither the federal government nor any gas utility has adequate\
  \ funding to implement the above project.To create the required infrastructure it\
  \ was therefore necessary that a new Cess may be imposed.He also accepted the idea\
  \ of some opposition Senators for forming a committee to point out anomalies in\
  \ the bill, which would prepare its recommendations to make the bill more beneficial.The\
  \ minister went on to say that it would be the current government, which has planned\
  \ to provide gas to every district of Balochistan\x96 APP/Geo News \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
