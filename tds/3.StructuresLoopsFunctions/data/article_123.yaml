content: "Hong Kong: Most Asian markets rose Friday, taking a positive lead from Wall\
  \ Street where the Nasdaq broke a 15-year-old record high, while the euro ticked\
  \ higher ahead of a key eurozone meeting to discuss Greece´s debt crisis.Oil prices\
  \ edged down after another rally that has been fuelled by worries that unrest in\
  \ Yemen could hit Middle East supplies.Hong Kong added 0.45 percent, Sydney rose\
  \ 1.19 percent and Seoul gained 0.23 percent while Singapore put on 0.41 percent\
  \ and Taipei jumped 1.35 percent.However, Tokyo slipped 0.55 percent and Shanghai\
  \ lost 0.68 percent.With few catalysts in Asia, investors tracked their US counterparts,\
  \ where the tech-heavy Nasdaq passed its previous record high set at the peak of\
  \ the dot-com boom.The index added 0.42 percent to finish at 5,056.06, finally making\
  \ up the nearly 4,000 points lost in a stunning crash that followed the previous\
  \ closing high set on March 10, 2000.The Dow gained 0.11 percent and the S&P added\
  \ 0.24 percent.Thursday´s advances came despite official data showing fresh claims\
  \ for US unemployment insurance benefits edged up marginally, while sales of new\
  \ homes plunged in March after a sharp rise in February.The figures will further\
  \ muddy the waters for the Federal Reserve as it debates when to hike record-low\
  \ interest rates. On forex markets the dollar eased to 119.50 yen from 119.55 yen\
  \ in New York late Thursday as expectations for an early summer hike narrow following\
  \ several below-par US readings lately.The euro bought $1.0814 and 129.25 yen against\
  \ $1.0823 and 129.39 yen in US trade.However, the single currency is still up from\
  \ the $1.0703 and 128.28 yen in Tokyo earlier Thursday ahead of the meeting of eurozone\
  \ finance ministers in Latvia´s capital Riga later in the day to talk about Greece.The\
  \ Eurogroup meeting comes with Athens running out of cash and struggling to reach\
  \ a bailout reform deal with its creditors that will unlock billions of euros to\
  \ service its debts to avert a default and likely exit from the eurozone.However,\
  \ Kathy Lien of BK Asset Management said that while there is optimism an agreement\
  \ can be reached \"in reality the rebound in (the euro) reflects short covering\
  \ ahead of the meeting\".Oil prices dipped on profit-taking after sharp gains Thursday\
  \ that came as a Saudi Arabia-led coalition renewed airstrikes against rebels in\
  \ Yemen.While Yemen is not a major producer, it sits on a key strategic entry point\
  \ into the Red Sea through which some 4.7 million barrels of oil pass each day.US\
  \ benchmark West Texas Intermediate fell 23 cents to $57.51 while Brent dipped 25\
  \ cents to $64.60.On Thursday WTI gained $1.58 and Brent advanced $2.12.Gold fetched\
  \ $1,193.36 against $1,189.92 late Thursday. (AFP)                        \r\n\r\
