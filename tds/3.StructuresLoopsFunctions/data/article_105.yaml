content: "London: Oil prices fell Tuesday, with profit-taking in evidence a day after\
  \ the market rallied on doubts over an agreement with Iran over the crude producer´s\
  \ nuclear programme, traders said. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for\
  \ delivery in May dropped 64 cents to $51.50 a barrel compared with Monday´s close.\
  \ Brent North Sea crude for May lost 46 cents to $57.66 in midday trade.The contracts\
  \ had surged by three dollars each on Monday.\"The current decline in oil prices\
  \ is most likely due to profit-taking,\" Ken Hasegawa, energy trading manager at\
  \ Newedge Group, told AFP. Analysts attributed the steep gains on Monday to investors\
  \ concluding that the nuclear framework agreed between Iran and international powers\
  \ will have a minimal near-term effect on global crude supplies.The deal Tehran\
  \ agreed with the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany\
  \ paves the way for the Islamic republic to curtail its nuclear activity in exchange\
  \ for relief from punishing economic sanctions, including on oil investment.\"Most\
  \ traders were waiting on Iran nuclear talks to cause a flood in Iranian oil as\
  \ sanctions get lifted,\" said Daniel Ang, investment analyst at Phillip Futures\
  \ in Singapore. \"However, the tone from the US seems firm and this means that sanctions\
  \ would only be lifted slowly,\" he added.Iran has the world´s fourth-largest oil\
  \ reserves but its exports have fallen from more than 2.2 million barrels per day\
  \ in 2011 to about 1.3 million because of the US-EU sanctions, which were put in\
  \ place to prevent it building a nuclear bomb. (AFP)                        \r\n\
