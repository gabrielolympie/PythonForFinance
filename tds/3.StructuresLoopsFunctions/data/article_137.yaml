  \ have been poor,\" Mitsushige Akino, executive officer at Ichiyoshi Asset Management\
  \ in Tokyo, told Bloomberg News.\"Sentiment could sour even more depending on the\
  \ April payrolls report. Risk-off moves could intensify if the US economic situation\
  \ is deemed weak.\"- US overheating? -Sentiment also took a hit as Yellen warned\
  \ that US stock markets were at risk of overheating.\"There are potential dangers\
  \ there,\" she told a conference, but added there was no rapid credit growth and\
  \ \"no signs of a financial bubble.\"\"I believe we are better positioned now\"\

  \ the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 0.48 percent, while the S&P 500 was down\
  \ 0.45 percent and the Nasdaq Composite Index lost 0.40 percent.Investors were also\

  \ up from 119.44 yen in New York.The euro was mixed at $1.1343 and 135.60 yen, compared\
