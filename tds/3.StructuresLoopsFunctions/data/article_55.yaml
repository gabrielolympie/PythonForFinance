  \ US crude inventories as traders kept an eye on unrest in crude exporter Libya.US\
  \ benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in March shed $1.39 to $52.14 a\
  \ barrel compared with Tuesday´s close.European benchmark Brent oil for April delivery\
  \ slid $2.00 to $60.53 a barrel in London.The US Department of Energy will release\
  \ its weekly stockpiles report on Thursday with many analysts expecting another\
  \ large rise in stocks.Last week´s report showed that US crude inventories reached\
  \ their highest levels on record for this time of the year.\"The market had a very\
  \ nice rebound from the $44-45 low it made a little while back,\" said Kyle Cooper,\
  \ analyst at IAF Advisors in Houston.\"But the fundamentals are still on the downside,\
  \ and expectations are for a crude oil build\" on Thursday.\"I don´t think the production\
  \ growth is going to slow in the next couple of months.\"Although leading producers\
  \ like Chevron and ConocoPhillips have slashed capital budgets in light of the more\
  \ than 50 percent plunge in global crude prices, the cuts are not expected to significantly\
  \ affect short-term production levels.Traders were also keeping an eye on developments\
  \ in north African crude oil producer Libya.Infighting and sabotage in Libya has\
  \ reduced output to 150,000 barrels a day, down from a high of almost 1.5 million\
  \ barrels per day, according to analysts. (AFP)                        \r\n\r\n\r\
