content: "NEW YORK: Crude-oil prices fell Thursday after six world powers and Iran\
  \ announced they had agreed on a framework to curb Iran\x92s nuclear drive.With\
  \ the tentative deal, if confirmed, likely to allow Iran crude exports back on the\
  \ markets, Brent North Sea crude for delivery in May, the global benchmark contract,\
  \ slumped $2.15, settling at $54.95 a barrel in London trade.The US benchmark, West\
  \ Texas Intermediate (WTI) for May delivery, shed 95 cents to close at $49.14 a\
  \ barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Traders have been following the marathon\
  \ negotiations closely. Shortly before the New York market closed, the world powers\
  \ and Iran said that Tehran has agreed to curtail its nuclear program in return\
  \ for the lifting of US and European Union nuclear-related sanctions that have harmed\
  \ its economy.Lifting sanctions could open up the flow of Iranian crude to an oversupplied\
  \ global market. The glut has pushed crude prices more than 50 percent lower since\
  \ last June.The outline of the deal marked a major breakthrough in a 12-year standoff\
  \ between Iran and the West, which has long feared Tehran wants to build a nuclear\
  \ bomb. Iran has insisted the nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.At the beginning\
  \ of the press conference in Lausanne, Switzerland, the price of WTI, which had\
  \ been trading lower since the market opened, fell to $48.11 a barrel before paring\
  \ its losses.The countries announced the drafting of a full agreement would begin\
  \ immediately, with a June 30 deadline for completion.The sanctions would be lifted\
  \ after the UN atomic agency verifies Iran has fulfilled the terms of the deal.The\
  \ so-called P5+1 group \x96 the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia\
  \ plus Germany \x96 hope that the deal will make it virtually impossible for Iran\
  \ to make nuclear weapons under the guise of its civilian program.Commerzbank analysts,\
  \ citing shipping sources, said earlier this week that Iran has at least 30 million\
  \ barrels of crude oil in storage onboard tankers that could quickly move onto the\
  \ market if sanctions were lifted.Iran has the world´s fourth-largest oil reserves.\
  \ The OPEC member´s crude exports have fallen from more than 2.2 million barrels\
  \ per day in 2011 to about 1.3 million bpd because of the US-EU sanctions.Traders\
  \ also kept an eye on the latest Baker Hughes count of US crude-oil drilling rigs,\
  \ looking for clues that the strong US crude output could be easing. The count fell\
  \ by 11 rigs from last week, and the number of operating rigs has fallen more than\
  \ 50 percent since October.                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
