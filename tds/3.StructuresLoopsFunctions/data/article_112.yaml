content: "Hong Kong: Most Asia markets climbed Monday, with Hong Kong advancing for\
  \ an eighth straight session and Shanghai rallying after another disappointing batch\
  \ of Chinese data that will add to hopes for fresh easing measures.Wall Street provided\
  \ another strong lead, boosted by a string of merger announcements last week and\
  \ a huge asset sale by General Electric (GE).Hong Kong was up 0.41 percent -- adding\
  \ to the more than 11 percent gain seen over the past seven days -- while Shanghai\
  \ ticked 1.30 percent higher. Sydney added 0.20 percent and Seoul put on 0.12 percent,\
  \ but Tokyo retreated 0.13 percent by lunch.In China the customs administration\
  \ said imports and exports sank in March, the latest figures to show the world´s\
  \ number two economy continues to struggle. However, they will also reinforce investors´\
  \ expectations that authorities will unveil a new round of growth-fuelling policies.Those\
  \ expectations have powered a rally in Shanghai shares to seven-year highs over\
  \ the past 12 months, and now mainlanders are jumping into Hong Kong´s market looking\
  \ for what they consider cheap equities. Hong Kong´s Hang Seng Index has climbed\
  \ more than 11 percent over the past seven sessions, and is on course for another\
  \ rise Monday.Turnover hit two successive records last week as traders north of\
  \ the border make the most of a link-up between the index and Shanghai´s exchange.While\
  \ the stock connect programme was initially met with little interest, the decision\
  \ by mainland authorities last month to expand the number of fund-management firms\
  \ allowed to buy in Hong Kong has seen activity surge.Attention will now turn to\
  \ the release Wednesday of Chinese economic growth figures for the first three months\
  \ of the year.In New York the Dow got a bump from GE´s announcement that it will\
  \ sell $26.5 billion in real estate assets as part of a plan to pare off most of\
  \ its GE Capital unit over the next 24 months. That came at the end of a week that\
  \ also saw major mergers including Royal Dutch Shell and FedEx.The Dow climbed 0.55\
  \ percent, the S&P 500 rose 0.52 percent and the Nasdaq gained 0.43 percent.On currency\
  \ markets the dollar was at 120.31 yen, compared with 120.30 yen in New York.The\
  \ euro bought $1.0590 and 127.41 yen against $1.0599 and 127.50 yen.Oil prices edged\
  \ higher. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for May delivery gained 28 cents\
  \ to $51.92 while Brent crude for May rose 25 cents to $58.12. Gold fetched $1,209.41\
  \ against $1,202.92 late Friday. (AFP)                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
