content: "KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Wednesday dismissed the Civil Aviation\
  \ Authority (CAA) order suspending the operation of Air Indus from July 1. The SHC\
  \ heard a petition filed by Air Indus whose lawyer informed the court that CAA had\
  \ imposed the suspension on Air Indus under CAA Policy 2015. He added that the National\
  \ Aviation Policy has been challenged by Air Indus in SHC and thus no action can\
  \ be taken under it. The petition states that before taking action no show-cause\
  \ was issued. The court suspended the CAA order and has issued notices to the federal\
  \ government and CAA for July 6. On Tuesday, the CAA said unsafe condition and persistent\
  \ violation of the safety regulations are endangering the safety of Air Indus aircrafts\
  \ and life of passengers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
