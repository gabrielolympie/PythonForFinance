  \ had topped one million for the first time, as it reported a jump in quarterly\
  \ profits.The prestigious US daily, which is seeking to manage a transition to digital,\
  \ said it hit the milestone for digital-only subscriptions on July 30, some four-and-a-half\
  \ years after launching its pay model.The more than one million digital-only subscribers\
  \ are in addition to Times´ 1.1 million print subscribers, who also get access to\
  \ digital news.\"This is a major milestone for our digital consumer business, which\
  \ we launched in 2011 and has continued a strong and steady growth trajectory. It\
  \ puts us in a unique position among global news providers,\" said Mark Thompson,\
  \ president and chief executive of the New York Times Company.\"We believe that\
  \ no other news organisation has achieved digital subscriber numbers like ours or\
  \ comparable digital subscription revenue. It´s a tribute to the hard work and innovation\
  \ of our marketing, product and technology teams and the continued excellence of\
  \ our journalism.\"The Times began its online paywall strategy in 2011 and has been\
  \ emphasising digital as print circulation and advertising decline.In 2012, the\
  \ company said it took in more revenue from circulation than advertising for the\
  \ first time.Thompson said international customers represent about 13 percent of\
  \ the digital subscribers, noting that it was \"a percentage we expect will continue\
  \ to grow very nicely in the coming quarters.\"Digital traffic was up 27 percent\
  \ year-over-year, to an average of 60 million monthly users, which helps boost ad\
  \ revenues, according to Thomson.Ken Doctor, a media analyst at Outsell, said the\
  \ milestone for the newspaper is \"worth celebrating for all who value journalism.\"\
  But Doctor said the newspaper cannot rest on its laurels.\"The next generation of\
  \ Times execs faces this question: What do we build on top of the paywall?\" he\
  \ said in a blog post.This model \"can only take the Times so far; it needs to find\
  \ additional spigots of reader revenue to get past flat revenue and into growth.\"\
  - Quarterly numbers -The Times said separately that its profit for the second quarter\
  \ jumped 79 percent from a year ago to $16.4 million.The rise in profit came amid\
  \ lower costs, while revenues dipped 1.5 percent from a year earlier, to $382 million.Circulation\
  \ revenues grew, but failed to make up for the drop in advertising revenues.Second-quarter\
  \ print advertising revenue fell 12.8 percent while digital ad sales grew 14.2 percent.\
  \ Digital advertising pulled in $48.3 million, or 32.5 percent, of total ad revenues\
  \ for the quarter ending June 30.Digital ad growth \"was again driven by growth\
  \ in mobile, paid posts and video,\" Thompson said.\"Expense management will remain\
  \ a top priority as we head into the second half of 2015, although our emphasis\
  \ on digital investment and execution is also more intense than ever.\"Thompson\
  \ said he expects to boost readership through partnerships recently announced with\
  \ Facebook and Starbucks. Facebook delivers \"instant articles\" through the social\
  \ network and Starbucks allows its customers access to Times´ articles.\"We expect\
  \ all of these platforms to contribute to our digital audience and revenue growth,\"\
  \ he said.                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
