content: "LONDON: Gold fell back towards five-year lows on Wednesday as investors\
  \ continued to pull away from the precious metal, with a slide through key chart\
  \ levels earlier this week setting prices up for further losses.A looming rise in\
  \ US interest rates, the first in nearly a decade, has dented gold's investment\
  \ appeal, encouraging more sellers in the market after Monday's 3 percent rout,\
  \ its biggest one-day drop since September 2013.Holdings in top gold-backed exchange-traded\
  \ fund (ETF) SPDR Gold Trust fell for a fourth day on Tuesday, declining another\
  \ 4.8 tonnes to hit their lowest since 2008. Its reserves have nearly halved from\
  \ their 2012 peak.Spot gold was down 0.5 percent at $1,095.69 an ounce at 0940 GMT,\
  \ while US gold futures for August delivery were down $8.70 an ounce at $1,094.80.\
  \ On Monday, gold slid to its lowest since March 2009 at $1,088.05 an ounce.It failed\
  \ to benefit from a softer tone to the dollar and stock markets on Wednesday, which\
  \ usually would be expected to give some respite to the metal.\"We expect further\
  \ losses in gold,\" Commerzbank analyst Daniel Briesemann said. \"Gold prices are\
  \ falling against the weaker dollar, declining equity markets -- those are clearly\
  \ bad signs. Everything speaks against rising gold prices.\"ETF investors are getting\
  \ rid of their holdings, and it seems speculators are also continuing to sell. It's\
  \ a perfect storm for gold,\" he said. \"Expectations about the developments of\
  \ US interest rates are clearly an underlying trend.\"Monday's selloff came on the\
  \ back of huge volumes traded on the Shanghai Gold Exchange after investors dumped\
  \ more than $500 million of bullion in New York in four seconds during early Asian\
  \ trading hours.That sparked a slide through key chart levels, triggering stop-loss\
  \ orders that added to momentum. From a technical perspective, gold remains under\
  \ pressure.\"Our next price target is seen at $1,044, the 2010 low, followed by\
  \ $1,006, the late 2009 high,\" technical analysts at ScotiaMocatta said in a note.\
  \ \"Lower lows and lower highs keep this bearish price move in motion. Only a close\
  \ back above $1,133 will stabilize the metal.\"Physical demand has been sluggish\
  \ despite this week's steep price drop. India is not rushing to pick up slack Chinese\
  \ demand as would-be buyers wait for further price drops, with a wedding season\
  \ lull and poor rains curbing appetite.Spot platinum was down 0.9 percent at $968.95\
  \ an ounce, while palladium was down 1.1 percent at $618.90, both trading near multi-year\
  \ lows. Silver was down 0.3 percent at $14.77 an ounce.                        \r\
