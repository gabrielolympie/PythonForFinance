  \ on strong gains in April following massive falls earlier in the year.US benchmark\
  \ West Texas Intermediate for delivery in June won 56 cents to $59.49 a barrel.Brent\
  \ North Sea crude for June won 47 cents to stand at $66.93 a barrel in London midday\
  \ deals.After slumping at the start of the year, oil prices rose by about a fifth\
  \ in value during April owing to several factors including concerns about unrest\
  \ in Yemen, the weakening dollar and fewer US rigs in operation, analysts said.However,\
  \ prices remain well down after plunging almost 60 percent between June and the\
  \ start of 2015 on the back of a global supply glut and ramped up production.\"\
  Crude oil producers in the US have significantly cut back output in an attempt to\
  \ address the significant supply overhang which has exerted downward pressure on...\
  \ prices since June last year,\" Kash Kamal, senior research analyst at Sucden brokers\
  \ said on Tuesday.The International Monetary Fund has said that Gulf oil exporters\
  \ must reduce spending, including subsidies, and diversify their economies to cope\
  \ with lower revenues caused by the sharp drop in crude prices.The wealthy monarchies,\
  \ however, should \"not react in a knee-jerk way to lower oil prices\", the IMF\
  \ Middle East and Central Asia chief Masood Ahmed told AFP in an interview Monday.\"\
  Saudi Arabia seem committed to defending their market share and have even increased\
  \ output to over 10 million barrels per day in April,\" said Kamal.\"Support for\
  \ higher crude prices has partly come from a weaker dollar,\" he added.A weaker\
  \ dollar makes oil priced in the US unit cheaper for holders of others currencies,\
  \ boosting demand. (AFP)                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
