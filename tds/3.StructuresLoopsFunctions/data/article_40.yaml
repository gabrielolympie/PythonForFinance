content: "LONDON: British bank HSBC Holdings Plc admitted on Sunday failings by its\
  \ Swiss subsidiary, in response to media reports it helped wealthy customers dodge\
  \ taxes and conceal millions of dollars of assets.\"We acknowledge and are accountable\
  \ for past compliance and control failures,\" HSBC said on Sunday after news outlets\
  \ including French newspaper Le Monde and Britain\x92s The Guardian published allegations\
  \ about its Swiss private bank. The Guardian, along with other news outlets, cited\
  \ documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists\
  \ (ICIJ) via Le Monde.HSBC said that its Swiss arm had not been fully integrated\
  \ into HSBC after its purchase in 1999, allowing \"significantly lower\" standards\
  \ of compliance and due diligence to persist.The Guardian alleged in its report\
  \ that the files showed HSBC's Swiss bank routinely allowed clients to withdraw\
  \ \x93bricks\x94 of cash, often in foreign currencies which were of little use in\
  \ Switzerland, marketed schemes which were likely to enable wealthy clients to avoid\
  \ European taxes and colluded with some to conceal undeclared accounts from domestic\
  \ tax authorities.HSBC said the Swiss private banking industry, long known for its\
  \ secrecy, operated differently in the past and this may have resulted in HSBC having\
  \ had \"a number of clients that may not have been fully compliant with their applicable\
  \ tax obligations.\"Its private bank, especially its Swiss arm, had undergone \"\
  a radical transformation\" in recent years, it said in a detailed four-page statement.HSBC's\
  \ Swiss private bank was largely acquired as part of its purchase of Republic National\
  \ Bank of New York and Safra Republic Holdings, a US private bank.HSBC said the\
  \ number of accounts in its Swiss private bank had fallen from 30,412 in 2007 to\
  \ 10,343 at the end of last year and it was cooperating with authorities investigating\
  \ tax matters.The data was supplied by Herve Falciani, a former IT employee of HSBC's\
  \ Swiss private bank. HSBC said Falciani downloaded details of accounts and clients\
  \ at the end of 2006 and early 2007. French authorities have obtained data on thousands\
  \ of the customers and shared them with tax authorities elsewhere, including Argentina.Switzerland\
  \ has charged Falciani, who Reuters was unable to reach for comment, with industrial\
  \ espionage and breaching the country's secrecy laws. Falciani has previously told\
  \ Reuters he is a whistleblower trying to help governments track down citizens who\
  \ used Swiss accounts to evade tax.Some of the details of the list have been released\
  \ before. The names of 2,000 Greeks with HSBC accounts was made public in 2010 and\
  \ dubbed the \"Lagarde List\" after former French finance minister Christine Lagarde.\
  \ France passed the names to Greece to help it crack down on tax evasion.      \
