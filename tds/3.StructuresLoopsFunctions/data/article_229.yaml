content: "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's car market has been dominated by Japanese automakers\
  \ for decades, but a mini-economic revival looks set to attract new players from\
  \ Europe and Korea into the mix.Despite heavy taxation on imported vehicles, enthusiasm\
  \ for owning a car in Pakistan has remained undented \x96 thanks in part to underdeveloped\
  \ public transport in the country´s sprawling cities, but also the social status\
  \ it brings.Toyota, Suzuki and Honda car assembly plants already work around the\
  \ clock in the southern port city of Karachi and eastern Lahore \x96 yet customers\
  \ can still wait for up to four months for new vehicles to be delivered.Now demand\
  \ for cars in the South Asian giant of 200 million people is accelerating even more\
  \ quickly, as economic growth has reached its fastest pace since 2008 while renewed\
  \ investor confidence and easing inflation have spurred consumer spending.Keen to\
  \ cash in, a delegation from German auto giant Volkswagen visited the country in\
  \ recent weeks, according to Pakistani officials and German diplomats.Company spokesman\
  \ Christoph Adomat told AFP that while \"Volkswagen is constantly evaluating market\
  \ opportunities on a worldwide basis... there are no decisions for an investment\
  \ from Volkswagen side in Pakistan\".Miftah Ismail, the chairman of Pakistan Board\
  \ of Investment who took part in the talks, said Volkswagen was not the only company\
  \ expressing an interest. \"There are a number of other companies from (South) Korea\
  \ and Europe that we are talking to who are thinking of setting up assembly plants\
  \ in Pakistan,\" he said, without naming the firms.Japanese strangleholdUS and European\
  \ cars dominated Pakistan´s roads in the early years after it gained independence\
  \ from Britain in 1947.But fuel prices made their compact, efficient Japanese rivals\
  \ more popular and from the 1960s onwards manufacturers like Toyota, Suzuki and\
  \ Honda gained a stranglehold on the market.Italy's Fiat made a brief foray in the\
  \ 1990s, while South Korea´s Hyundai as well as Daewoo-owned Chevrolet tried \x96\
  \ and failed \x96 to gain a foothold in the 2000s before the financial crisis forced\
  \ them to exit.Because Pakistan charges heavy duties on imported cars less than\
  \ three years old, Japanese companies with in-country assembly operations can set\
  \ prices significantly above the regional average.The bottom-of-the-range Suzuki\
  \ Mehran costs the equivalent of $6,300 in Pakistan but sells for around $3,900\
  \ in neighbouring India. The most popular Corolla 1.3 sedan starts at 1.6 million\
  \ rupees ($16,000), but buyers have to wait months or pay $1,500 for prompt delivery.The\
  \ news that Volkswagen was exploring options to enter the Pakistani market has excited\
  \ car enthusiasts, who are tired of high prices and limited choices.\"I think it\
  \ is a great idea because Volkswagen cars are value for money and reliability,\"\
  \ said Romano Karim, a fan of the classic Volkswagen Beetles from the 60s and 70s\
  \ that can often be seen on Pakistan´s roads.Haji Mohammad Shahzad, chairman of\
  \ the All Pakistan Motor Dealers Association, added that having Volkswagen in the\
  \ market would help drive costs down.\"The monopoly of big three could be broken\
  \ if Volkswagen produces at least 20,000-25,000 cars annually,\" Shahzad told AFP.Renewed\
  \ confidenceGlobal auto giants are attracted by Pakistan´s booming economy, which\
  \ the International Monetary Fund predicts will grow by 4.5 percent in the next\
  \ financial year. Investor confidence in the medium-sized economy of $232 billion\
  \ has improved since a new business-friendly government led by Nawaz Sharif took\
  \ power in 2013, with Karachi´s share market among the world´s top 10 performers\
  \ in the past year.The country is also undergoing a major construction boom driven\
  \ by Chinese investment after President Xi Jinping visited Islamabad in April to\
  \ unveil a $46 billion investment plan known as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.Car\
  \ sales have also boomed thanks to the growth of car leasing and financing facilities.\
  \ Sales in the 11 months to May this year rose 30 percent from a year earlier, according\
  \ to industry group the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association.Baber Kaleem\
  \ Khan, editor of PakWheels.com magazine, said Volkswagen would be well poised to\
  \ tap into the lower to mid-range market.\"Pakistani automakers haven´t really had\
  \ much competition because their respective domains are well protected by monopolistic\
  \ business practices,\" Khan told AFP.\"But given VW´s impressive small-range of\
  \ vehicles, the German automaker can take the market from the ground up and start\
  \ working to the top.\"                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
