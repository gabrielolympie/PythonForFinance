content: "Tokyo: Asian shares were mixed Tuesday morning with Tokyo buoyed by a weak\
  \ yen but falling commodity prices raised fears about global growth as Chinese stocks\
  \ slipped after a brief reprieve in their month-long rout.Tokyo´s benchmark Nikkei\
  \ 225 index rose 0.43 percent, Hong Kong was up 0.23 percent, Seoul was flat, Sydney\
  \ gained 0.14 percent, while Singapore edged down 0.06 percent.Chinese shares fell\
  \ sharply at the open as investors grew cautious after the market approached the\
  \ key 4,000-point level, dealers said.The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index dropped\
  \ 1.64 percent while the Shenzhen Composite Index, which tracks stocks on China´s\
  \ second exchange, lost 1.91 percent.Both indices moved back into positive territory\
  \ in later trading. The fresh volatility comes after Beijing launched a series of\
  \ initiatives to staunch a bloodletting that saw a 30 percent plunge in Shanghai\
  \ and trillions wiped off valuations.Among the measures were a police crackdown\
  \ on short-selling and a ban on big shareholders and company executives from selling\
  \ stock for six months, adding to earlier announcements.Meanwhile, dealers said\
  \ a drop in commodities prices raised concerns about the global economy as crude\
  \ oil briefly fell below $50 a barrel on Tuesday, and gold traded near a five-year\
  \ low.\"This commodities rout is a very big concern,\" Michael McCarthy, a chief\
  \ strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, told Bloomberg News. \"There´s risk for a\
  \ further downside. It looks like the overall global growth outlook is continuing\
  \ to slow.\"Investors were also keeping an eye on Greece where the government hiked\
  \ taxes and paid billions of euros to its creditors on Monday, as banks reopened\
  \ just days after the debt-laden country reached a bailout deal with its creditors.In\
  \ currency markets, the dollar was trading around a five-week high at 124.34 yen,\
  \ against 124.30 yen in New York on Monday.The euro bought $1.0825 and 134.61 yen,\
  \ little changed from $1.0824 and 134.55 yen in US trading.\"The weaker yen and\
  \ cheaper oil will have a positive effect on Japanese stocks,\" said Toshihiko Matsuno,\
  \ chief strategist at SMBC Friend Securities Co. in Tokyo.Eyes are now on Washington\
  \ as the Federal Reserve considers when to hike interest rates from their record\
  \ lows as the US economy gets back up to speed. Last week Fed chief Janet Yellen\
  \ said she saw a rise taking place before 2016 -- a rate hike is a plus for the\
  \ dollar.Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank are spending hundreds\
  \ of billions of dollars on bonds and other assets to support their respective economies,\
  \ pushing down the value of the yen and euro.On oil markets, US benchmark West Texas\
  \ Intermediate for August delivery was down 10 cents to $50.05, after briefly dipping\
  \ to $49.94, and Brent crude for September fell eight cents to $56.57 a barrel in\
  \ morning Asian trade.Gold fetched $1,103.54 after falling as low as $1,072 per\
  \ ounce in Asia trade Monday. (AFP) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
