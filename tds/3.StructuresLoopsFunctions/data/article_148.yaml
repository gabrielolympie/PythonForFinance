content: "WASHINGTON: President Barack Obama Thursday called US oil production an\
  \ \x93important\x94 source of energy as America transitions towards cleaner resources,\
  \ defending his move to allow petroleum giant Shell to drill in the Alaskan Arctic.ObamaÂ´s\
  \ administration gave the petroleum giant a green light three days ago to explore\
  \ the Chukchi Sea near Alaska -- as long as the Anglo-Dutch firm has the correct\
  \ permits from the agencies that regulate the environment and marine mammal health.Environmental\
  \ groups oppose the drilling due to the vulnerability of Arctic animals that are\
  \ already struggling with melting sea ice and the risk that an oil spill would pose\
  \ to the region.\"Despite the fact that Shell had put in an application for exploration\
  \ in this region several years ago, we delayed it for a very lengthy period of time,\
  \ until they could provide us with the kinds of assurances that we have not seen\
  \ before,\" Obama said during a Thursday press conference.Shell put its drilling\
  \ plans for the Alaska Arctic on hold in 2013 following multiple embarrassing problems\
  \ with its two rigs.One, the Kulluk, washed ashore after breaking loose from towing\
  \ vessels in stormy seas in southern Alaska in January.Another, the Noble Discoverer,\
  \ was recently cited by the US Coast Guard for numerous safety and operational deficiencies.Both\
  \ rigs were sent to Asia for repair and maintenance work.\"Shell had to go back\
  \ to the drawing board, revamp its approach,\" Obama said.\"I am working internationally\
  \ to reduce our carbon emissions and to replace, over time, fossil fuels with clean\
  \ energies,\" he added.\"In the meantime, we are going to continue to be using fossil\
  \ fuels, and when it can be done safely and appropriately, US production of oil\
  \ and natural gas is important,\" Obama said.He added that importing oil and gas\
  \ meant it might be \"purchased from places that have much lower environmental standards\
  \ than we do.\"Some Americans grew increasingly wary of drilling after the April\
  \ 2010 explosion of BP-leased Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico, which killed\
  \ 11 people and spewed 4.9 million barrels of oil into the ocean.A Shell spokesman\
  \ said that operations in the Chukchi Sea are scheduled to begin in the coming months.\
