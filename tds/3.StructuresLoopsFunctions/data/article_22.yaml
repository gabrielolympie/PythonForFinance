  \ blackouts is weighing on its credit worthiness and hindering its ability to meet\
  \ key reform targets laid out by the IMF, ratings agency Moody´s warned Monday.\
  \ The country is currently in the grip of one of its worst power crises in years\
  \ due to a shortfall in imported oil, with the situation exacerbated Sunday by an\
  \ attack on a key powerline in restive Balochistan province. Moody´s said that increasing\
  \ energy imports without addressing structural issues that create so-called circular\
  \ debt \"will further strain Pakistan's budget and balance of payments, a credit\
  \ negative\". \"Fuel shortages also reflect the strained finances of state-owned\
  \ distribution companies and the fuel importer, Pakistan State Oil corporation,\
  \ and are a setback to the sector's progress on reforms made so far under Pakistan's\
  \ financial support program with the International Monetary Fund.\"The IMF granted\
  \ a $6.6-billion loan to Pakistan in September 2013 on the condition that it carry\
  \ out extensive economic reforms, particularly in the energy and taxation sectors.Moody´s,\
  \ which in July 2014 upgraded Pakistan's rating outlook from \"negative\" to \"\
  stable\" in a boon for the shaky South Asian economy, said that structural reforms\
  \ had been a \"key driver\" in its decision last year. \"Circular debt\" -- brought\
  \ on by the dual effect of the government setting low electricity prices and customers\
  \ failing to pay -- is at the heart of the crisis. State utilities lose money, and\
  \ cannot pay private power generating companies, which in turn cannot pay the oil\
  \ and gas suppliers, who cut off the supply. The fuel crisis began last week when\
  \ Pakistan State Oil was forced to slash imports because banks refused to extend\
  \ any more credit to the government-owned company, which supplies 80 percent of\
  \ the country´s oil. The shortfall led to long queues of angry motorists at petrol\
  \ stations, though these have since dissipated as fuel supplies have reached the\
  \ pumps. But Moody´s warned that the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif,\
  \ which made solving the energy crisis a key campaign pledge, had so far failed\
  \ to offer policy solutions and increasing oil supplies would only add to the fiscal\
  \ burden. \"The government´s targeted fiscal deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP in fiscal\
  \ 2015 from 4.7 percent in fiscal 2014 is already impeded by delays in implementing\
  \ electricity tariff adjustments and legal challenges related to tax collections,\"\
  \ it said. Increasing fuel imports, which currently comprise 35 percent of total\
  \ imports would further weigh on Pakistan´s import bill, it added.             \
  \           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
