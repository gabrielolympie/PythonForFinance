content: "BRASILIA: Chinese Premier Li Keqiang lifted the wraps Tuesday on a multibillion-dollar\
  \ series of trade and investment deals with Brazil, as Beijing looks to invest $53\
  \ billion in South America\x92s largest economy.The news unveiled at the start of\
  \ Li´s first official visit to Latin America is a huge boon for Brazil as it endures\
  \ a fifth straight year of low growth after a period of rapid expansion fueled by\
  \ Asian demand for commodities that has since slowed.Li´s host, President Dilma\
  \ Rousseff, hopes Brazil can direct Chinese cash to overhaul decaying infrastructure\
  \ as the country´s tourist magnet Rio de Janeiro prepares to host South America´s\
  \ first ever Olympics next year.Headlining 35 deals on Li´s first official visit\
  \ to Latin America were a pair of finance and cooperation agreements worth $7 billion\
  \ for Brazil´s state-owned oil firm Petrobras.Rousseff, who will make a state visit\
  \ next year to China, spoke of a \"new intensity in our relations.\"\"China and\
  \ Brazil are playing a leading role in the construction of a new global order,\"\
  \ she added.Rousseff, re-elected in October, has been battling a welter of negative\
  \ economic data as well as fallout from a huge graft scandal at Petrobras.Li pointed\
  \ to China´s \"rich experience\" in building infrastructure, saying Beijing \"would\
  \ like to cooperate with Brazil in reducing its costs.\"Despite a multibillion-dollar\
  \ kickbacks scandal battering its reputation as Brazil´s flagship company, Petrobras\
  \ had earlier this year received another Beijing boost in signing a $3.5 billion\
  \ financing deal with the China Investment Bank.Despite becoming Brazil´s number\
  \ one trading partner in 2009, amid an exponential rise in two-way trade, China\
  \ currently ranks only 12th in terms of actual investment in Brazil, prompting Brasilia\
  \ to seek deeper economic ties.The Chinese are notably supplying new metro trains\
  \ and catamarans to Rio and Li will visit the Olympic host city Wednesday to inspect\
  \ those investments before leaving Thursday for Colombia ahead of trips to Peru\
  \ and Chile.Li´s tour, aimed at underpinning growing Chinese influence in Latin\
  \ America, comes just days after Beijing signed accords worth $25 billion and $22\
  \ billion respectively with fellow BRICS developing nations Russia. But the Brazil\
  \ package is worth more than those combined.- Air deals, railroad dreams -Aside\
  \ from the Petrobras agreements, Rousseff and Li also signed a range of deals designed\
  \ to further bilateral cooperation on trade, investment, agriculture, energy and\
  \ transport.Brasilia and Beijing also finalised a $1.3 billion accord to sell 22\
  \ Brazilian Embraer commercial jets to China´s Tianjin Airlines, Embraer said.Brazil´s\
  \ Vale, the world´s biggest iron producer, announced a range of deals including\
  \ extended cooperation with China on maritime transport of iron ore.Among the deals,\
  \ Vale said it would expand an existing accord by selling four ore carriers to China\
  \ Merchants Energy Shipping Co. Ltd and also also signed a memorandum of understanding\
  \ with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China for up to $4 billion in loans\
  \ and other financial arrangements.China also vowed to lift an import ban on Brazilian\
  \ beef and signed onto an ambitious project to build a railway from the key southeastern\
  \ Brazilian port of Santos more than 3,500 kilometers (2,200 miles) to the Peruvian\
  \ Pacific port of Ilo.- Exponential growth -Bilateral trade between the BRICS developing\
  \ states has mushroomed over the past decade, with the Asian giant becoming Brazil´s\
  \ main trading partner in 2009.Trade between China and Latin America as a whole\
  \ exploded from barely $10 billion in 2000 to $255.5 billion in 2012.Sino-Brazilian\
  \ trade mushroomed from $6.5 billion in 2003 to $83.3 billion in 2012.Ahead of Li´s\
  \ arrival late Monday, Jose Graca Lima, head of Asian affairs in the Brazilian foreign\
  \ ministry, explained that a \"second generation\" of Chinese investment is underway,\
  \ switching from trade in raw materials to heavy industry and infrastructure.Facilitating\
  \ the movement of imports from Brazil -- and similarly that of its own exports to\
  \ Latin America -- is a key Chinese aim, pushing their interest in funding the mooted\
  \ $10 billion railway project through to Peru.Building the rail link would mean\
  \ that \"a new path to Asia will open up for Brazil, reducing distances and costs,\"\
  \ Rousseff told reporters. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
