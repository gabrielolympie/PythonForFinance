content: "LONDON: The US dollar hit multi-year highs against the euro and yen on Tuesday\
  \ on the growing chance of the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates by mid-year,\
  \ the prospect of which also hurt stocks and currencies from emerging markets.The\
  \ skittish mood spread from Asia to Europe where stocks were down for a second day\
  \ despite the European Central Bank's new bond buying campaign continuing to push\
  \ down the euro and the bloc's already record-low borrowing costs.Driving the dollar\
  \ up was speculation that the Federal Reserve, in contrast, will start lifting interest\
  \ rates from mid-year after another round of stellar jobs data on Friday and a subsequent\
  \ chorus of hawkish Fed policymaker comments.The euro's woes were compounded by\
  \ worries about Greece as euro zone finance ministers met in Brussels a day after\
  \ the head of the group, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, urged Athens to \"stop wasting time\"\
  \ and start implementing reforms.Selling in the euro had gathered pace again in\
  \ Europe as a break below a major layer of chart support at $1.0762 to $1.0735 left\
  \ bears eyeing 1.07 the figure and some mulling potential parity.The dollar also\
  \ broke higher on the yen in Asia to reach 122.02, territory not visited since July\
  \ 2007.\"It is all about the Fed now,\" said Aurelija Augulyte senior FX strategist\
  \ at Nordea in Helsinki. \"The ECB (bond buying) bias has now been fully digested,\
  \ but what the market is now trying to do is price in earlier Fed rate hikes.\"\
  The prospect of rising US yields threatened to draw funds away from emerging markets,\
  \ causing strains from Brazil to Turkey. The Brazilian real led the rout, having\
  \ fallen for the sixth straight session.The pressure spread then through Asia with\
  \ the South Korean won hitting its lowest since late August 2013 and the Singapore\
  \ dollar its lowest since 2010.Eastern Europe was also heavily in the red. Selling\
  \ accelerated for Poland's zloty, Romania's leu and Hungary's forint and MSCI's\
  \ main emerging market stock index fell 1 percent, down for its eighth day running.\
