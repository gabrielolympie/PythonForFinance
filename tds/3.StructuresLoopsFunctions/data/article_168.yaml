  \ fiscal year but per capita income rose significantly, giving hopes for ambitious\
  \ GDP growth in the coming year.Finance Minister Ishaq Dar on Thursday launched\
  \ the country\x92s \"Economic Survey\" for the outgoing year 2014-15, that reviews\
  \ all the aspects of Pakistan\x92s economy for the fiscal year ending June 30.Pakistan\
  \ had set its growth target at 5.1 per cent on the assumption of higher agricultural\
  \ production, improvement in energy supplies and better investment prospects.However,\
  \ with the key economic sectors missing their targets, GDP growth has been revised\
  \ to 4.24 per cent.\"According to provisional estimates the GDP growth during 2014-15\
  \ remained at 4.24 per cent,\" the minister, reading the survey, said at a televised\
  \ press conference.However, growth was higher than the 4.03 per cent posted in the\
  \ previous fiscal year, he said.The agriculture sector grew at 2.9 per cent compared\
  \ to the target of 3.3 per cent, industry grew 3.6 per cent against a target of\
  \ 6.8 per cent, and the services sector grew at 5.0 per cent, just short of the\
  \ 5.2 per cent target.The financial wizards, however, were enthralled with the sharp\
  \ growth in per capita income that rose by 9.25 per cent to $1,512 during the fiscal\
  \ year.\"The main contributing factors of this rapid increase in per capita income\
  \ include acceleration in real GDP growth, relatively lower growth in population\
  \ and the consistent Pakistani rupee,\" Dar said.Pakistan was also able to significantly\
  \ cut its current account deficit to 0.6 per cent of GDP from 1.3 per cent last\
  \ year for the first 10 months of the current fiscal.The financial year saw significant\
  \ achievements as interest rates were curtailed to seven per cent, a 42-year low\
  \ on the back of historic 4.8 percent inflation.Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif\x92\
  s government vowed to revive the Pakistani economy after he took over power in May\
  \ 2013.International credit rating agencies have upgraded Pakistan\x92s ratings.The\
  \ Sharif government is scheduled to table the national budget for the year 2015-16\
  \ in parliament on Friday.                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
