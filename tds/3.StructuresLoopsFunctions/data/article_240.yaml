content: "KARACHI: In a bid to increase the number of income tax returns, the Federal\
  \ Board of Revenue (FBR) has made mandatory for all salaried persons having taxable\
  \ income to file income tax returns electronically from Tax Year 2015.Through SRO\
  \ 791(I)/2015 issued on Tuesday, the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 has been amended\
  \ to make it mandatory for all individuals earning taxable income to file tax return\
  \ electronically for the tax year 2015, for which the last date is August 31, 2015.\
  \ Tax experts strongly criticised the move. They said salaried individuals were\
  \ a soft target, and by forcing salaried persons for filing returns the tax authorities\
  \ were trying to achieve their desired number.Earlier, the law required a person\
  \ earning Rs500,000 per year to file tax return electronically. While salaried persons\
  \ under threshold for income tax payment, ie Rs400,000 were also required to file\
  \ returns, but it was not mandatory through e-filing.Muhammad Zubair, President,\
  \ Karachi Tax Bar Association (KTBA) said the changes made by the FBR are disappointing,\
  \ as this shows they only want to increase the numbers instead of increasing the\
  \ tax revenue.He said that a large segment of salaried persons fall in the slab\
  \ of Rs400,000 to Rs500,000, which also includes the lower cadre of any corporate\
  \ entity. \x93In some cases even a peon of an entity will be filing tax return,\x94\
  \ he added.It is pertinent to mention here that a large number of the salaried class\
  \ already files income tax returns on an annual basis. According to data obtained\
  \ from a report of Tax Reform Commission, around 881,262 total returns were filed\
  \ in tax year 2013, out of which salary returns were 235,117.Rehan Jafri, General\
  \ Secretary, Pakistan Tax Bar Association (PTBA) criticised the FBR move and asked\
  \ the authority to first enable its e-portal to handle such a huge number of filings.He\
  \ said that the last date of filing the income tax return is August 31 and so far\
  \ the return forms have not been issued by the FBR. \x93It will create difficulties\
  \ for taxpayers to file in a short span of time,\x94 he said, adding the FBR should\
  \ have issued the form on July 1 allowing at least two months for filing preparation.The\
  \ FBR\x92s new online software for filing income tax returns IRIS (Integrated Risk\
  \ Information System) was criticised last year for deficiencies. Tax experts believe\
  \ that without addressing the issues it will be another failure for FBR.Shahid Hussain\
  \ Asad, Member Inland Revenue (Policy) and official spokesman said the measure had\
  \ been taken to ensure electronic availability of taxpayers\x92 data.As per tax\
  \ laws all the individuals are also required to file a wealth statement along with\
  \ their return. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
