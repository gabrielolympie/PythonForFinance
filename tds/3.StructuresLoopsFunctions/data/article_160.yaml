content: "London: World oil prices rose Wednesday on bargain-hunting after sharp falls\
  \ the previous day triggered by a strong US dollar and global supply glut concerns,\
  \ analysts said.In early afternoon London deals, Brent North Sea crude for July\
  \ added 36 cents to $64.08 per barrel, compared with Tuesday´s closing level.US\
  \ benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in July won 43 cents to $58.46\
  \ a barrel.Crude futures had shed more than $1.60 on Tuesday, as markets in the\
  \ United States and much of Europe reopened after a public holiday on Monday.Oil\
  \ prices have been under pressure on a resurgent dollar, which has strengthened\
  \ following expectations that the US Federal Reserve will follow through on plans\
  \ to raise record-low interest rates later this year.The stronger greenback makes\
  \ crude more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies.\"As the prices for crude\
  \ dropped quite sharply last night, the current rebound is due to bargain hunting\
  \ as traders pounce at the low prices,\" Nicholas Teo, market analyst at CMC Markets\
  \ in Singapore, told AFP.Teo said dealers are also awaiting the latest official\
  \ US stockpiles report for fresh clues about demand and production levels in the\
  \ world´s top crude consumer.Crude reserves likely fell by 1.5 million barrels in\
  \ the week to May 22, according to a survey by Bloomberg News.Overall US stockpiles,\
  \ which stand at 482.2 million barrels, are at the highest level since 1930, according\
  \ to data compiled by the US Energy Information Administration.The weekly report\
  \ is normally published every Wednesday but will be issued this Thursday due to\
  \ the US public holiday on Monday.Dealers have been hoping that a slowdown in US\
  \ output, coupled with increased demand during the summer driving season, could\
  \ whittle down the build up of global crude reserves, which was a key reason for\
  \ the collapse in prices of more than 50 percent between June and January.(AFP)\
