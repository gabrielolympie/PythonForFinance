content: "NEW YORK: The euro gained ground on Wednesday on hopes that Greece´s debt\
  \ crisis will be resolved in a few days, averting a default to its European Union\
  \ creditors.The euro, which had fallen to a five-week low of $1.0916 on Tuesday,\
  \ rebounded as Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras vowed to present \"credible\"\
  \ reform plans to creditors by Thursday.The 19-nation currency rose to $1.1074 around\
  \ 2100 GMT from $1.1007 at the same time Tuesday.European Union President Donald\
  \ Tusk has set the \"final deadline\" for a deal on Sunday at a summit of all 28\
  \ EU leaders.\"Between the unusual suspension of trading on the NYSE and the meltdown\
  \ in Asian equities, investors sent the euro higher on signs of progress towards\
  \ a deal for Greece,\" said Kathy Lien of BK Asset Management.The New York Stock\
  \ Exchange halted trading Wednesday for more than three hours due to technical problems\
  \ that it said were not caused by hacking.Meanwhile, a weeks-long rout in Chinese\
  \ equities continued, with stocks losing more than 30 percent since mid-June.The\
  \ Federal Reserve´s release of the minutes of the June 16-17 meeting of the Federal\
  \ Open Market Committee showed policymakers favored caution about embarking on the\
  \ first interest rate hike in nine years.Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth\
  \ Foreign Exchange, said the Fed minutes were less important to markets than normal\
  \ because of the heightened level of concern regarding Greece and China.\"On both\
  \ fronts, underlying conditions have deteriorated markedly since the Fed´s mid-June\
  \ meeting, so the minutes may be largely irrelevant at this point,\" he said.  \
