content: "SINGAPORE: Oil prices fell on Monday after closing the previous session\
  \ at their lowest levels since March on renewed oversupply concerns from the United\
  \ States and Iraq, although a weaker dollar helped to limit deeper losses.Investors\
  \ are looking to the US Federal Reserve for direction this week. The central bank\
  \ starts a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday that could result in a September interest\
  \ rate hike that would strengthen the greenback.\"The markets are looking for price\
  \ guidance from Janet & Co,\" said Ben Le Brun, market analyst at Sydney's OptionsXpress,\
  \ referring to Fed Chair Janet Yellen and the bank.\"There is scope for the dollar\
  \ bulls to be disappointed this week (which) might be a driver for oil prices and\
  \ the commodities complex overall,\" Le Brun said.A weaker dollar makes dollar-denominated\
  \ commodities, including oil, cheaper for consumers using other currencies.Brent\
  \ crude for September was down 2 cents at $54.60 a barrel as of 0655 GMT after dropping\
  \ 65 cents in the previous session to $54.62, its lowest close since March 19.US\
  \ crude for September was down 12 cents at $48.02, after falling 31 cents in the\
  \ previous session to $48.14, its lowest settlement since March 31. It hit an intra-day\
  \ low of $47.72 on Friday, the lowest intraday price since April 1.Sparking new\
  \ worries about a global glut, US oil producers added 21 drilling rigs last week,\
  \ the biggest rise since April 2014, according to Baker Hughes.The increase in drilling\
  \ activity came despite a 21 percent collapse in US crude prices from about $61\
  \ a barrel in mid-June. A 20 percent downturn is considered by many traders to constitute\
  \ a bear market.In Iraq, exports from its southern oilfields are on course for a\
  \ monthly record, having topped 3 million barrels per day so far this month, according\
  \ to loading data and an industry source.The expectation of continued abundant oil\
  \ supplies, including an output increase from Saudi Arabia and other members of\
  \ the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led the National Australia\
  \ Bank on Monday to revise its oil price forecasts in a monthly report.\"We now\
  \ expect oil prices to stay below $70 a barrel for the rest of 2015 and 2016,\"\
  \ the bank said.Speculators cut long bets on US crude futures and options to the\
  \ lowest level in five years last week, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission\
  \ said on Friday.                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
