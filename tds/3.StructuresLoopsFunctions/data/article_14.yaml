  \ Chinese economic data weighing on markets.Analysts said prices were receiving\
  \ some support around current levels but added that there was not much room for\
  \ larger price gains.\"Some positive data points helped to stabilize oil for now...Upbeat\
  \ IEA comments and a falling US rig count were the latest positive news. While the\
  \ news was able to halt oil's price decline, it was not enough to turn prices bullish,\"\
  \ Morgan Stanley said on Monday in a note.China is due to report gross domestic\
  \ product figures on Tuesday, which are expected to show China's full-year growth\
  \ would undershoot Beijing's 7.5-percent target and would be the weakest in 24 years.In\
  \ Europe, the main event of the week will be Thursday's meeting of the European\
  \ Central Bank (ECB), which is considered almost certain to see the launch of a\
  \ government bond-buying campaign, pointing to further euro falls against the dollar\

  \ prices would likely rise away from levels below $50 per barrel, but many noted\
  \ that the longer-term outlook was for oil prices to remain at lower levels than\
  \ in recent years.\"We do not subscribe to the theory of US$20/bbl (barrel) oil.\
  \ The price may go down to the US$30/bbl level for a short while, but it will bounce\
  \ back,\" research firm Facts Global Energy (FGE) said in its January note to clients.\"\
  We will be in the US$60-80/bbl price range till end of the decade,\" it added. \
