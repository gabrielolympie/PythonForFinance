content: "New York: Oil prices rebounded Tuesday from six-year lows as the dollar\
  \ weakened after disappointing US economic data.The US benchmark, West Texas Intermediate\
  \ (WTI) for March delivery, rose $1.08 (2.4 percent) to close at $45.16 a barrel.Brent\
  \ North Sea crude for March settled at $49.60 a barrel in London, up $1.44 from\
  \ Monday´s closing level.\"The market has found a bottom in the mid-40 range,\"\
  \ said Kyle Cooper of IAF Advisors.Crude futures sank Monday to their lowest closing\
  \ levels since early 2009. Crude has shed nearly 60 percent of its value in an almost\
  \ uninterrupted slide since June due to a supply glut, largely boosted by robust\
  \ US shale-oil production and weaker global economic growth.The greenback has been\
  \ strengthening for months, making dollar-priced oil relatively more expensive,\
  \ adding to the pressure on the oil market.A slight easing in the dollar Tuesday\
  \ against major rival currencies such as the euro, yen and pound underpinned the\
  \ buying, Cooper said.\"I didn´t see anything bullish today\" for WTI, he said.\
  \ \"Equities are down, durable goods (are) not that good.\"New orders for long-lasting\
  \ US industrial goods unexpectedly fell in December, by a steep 3.4 percent, signaling\
  \ some persistent weakness in the manufacturing sector.Saudi Aramco, the world´s\
  \ largest oil company in terms of crude production and exports, acknowledged that\
  \ prices have fallen too far but it was up to the market, not OPEC producers, to\
  \ shore them up.\"It´s too low for everybody,\" said Khalid al-Falih, the president\
  \ of the state-owned energy giant, told a conference in Riyadh. \"I think even consumers\
  \ start to suffer in the long term.\"Falih also said US shale-oil production is\
  \ important for the world´s long-term energy future and Saudi Aramco has earmarked\
  \ an additional $7 billion for its own shale projects.The kingdom is the leading\
  \ exporter and top producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries,\
  \ which provides about a third of global oil supplies.In November, OPEC resisted\
  \ calls to reduce output in the face of falling prices, keeping its output ceiling\
  \ at 30 million barrels per day in a decision that exacerbated the global price\
  \ slump. (AFP)                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
