content: "Singapore: Oil prices fell in thin pre-holiday trade in Asia Thursday after\
  \ a mixed US stockpiles report, while talks over crude producer Iran´s nuclear programme\
  \ dragged on, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate fell 40 cents to\
  \ $49.69 while Brent slipped 32 cents to $56.78 in afternoon trade.\"Prices have\
  \ come off with thin volumes ahead of the holiday tomorrow,\" Michael McCarthy,\
  \ chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, told AFP.Financial markets in\
  \ major crude trading hubs including Singapore, the United States and Britain will\
  \ be closed on Friday for the long Easter weekend.McCarthy said dealers were still\
  \ digesting the latest US Department of Energy´s weekly petroleum report released\
  \ Wednesday.The report, for the week to March 27, showed another increase in inventories\
  \ to a new record high of 471.4 million barrels.But it also revealed a slight decline\
  \ in US production of 36,000 barrels per day, ending a long climb to record output\
  \ levels that have contributed to the global supply glut.\"The decline in crude\
  \ production does give some hope that the state of oversupply can be brought under\
  \ control, and bring about a lift in prices,\" McCarthy said.Talks between Iran\
  \ and world powers aimed at preventing Tehran from getting a nuclear bomb remained\
  \ in focus, he added.\"We are a few metres... from the finishing line, but we are\
  \ well aware that the final metres are the hardest,\" French Foreign Minister Laurent\
  \ Fabius told reporters as he arrived late Wednesday back in Switzerland to rejoin\
  \ the negotiations.The United States, China, Britain, Russia, France and Germany\
  \ hope a full agreement, due to be finalised by June 30, will see Iran scale back\
  \ its nuclear capability, which would prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon.In\
  \ return, the diplomatically isolated Islamic republic, which denies wanting to\
  \ build a bomb, is demanding the lifting of sanctions that have strangled its energy-reliant\
  \ economy. (AFP)                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
