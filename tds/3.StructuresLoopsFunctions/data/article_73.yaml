content: "ISLAMABAD: The Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR) has begun chasing wealthy\
  \ tax-dodgers who enjoy lives of extravagance and luxury, but revenue officials\
  \ face huge challenges in trying to force the very richest \x97 and most influential\
  \ \x97 to pay up.Pakistan's tax-to-GDP ratio of 9.5 percent is among the lowest\
  \ in the world and the government is under pressure from foreign donors and lenders,\
  \ including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to increase collection to boost\
  \ the struggling economy.Revenue authorities say they have identified about a quarter\
  \ of a million new taxpayers who they project will add around 14 billion rupees\
  \ ($140 million) to government coffers.Broadening the tax base and improving the\
  \ economy after years of drift and sluggish growth under the last government was\
  \ a key pledge in Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif´s 2013 election campaign, when he\
  \ was swept to power for a third time.Currently less than one percent of Pakistanis\
  \ pay income tax and the government collected just $8 billion in total income tax\
  \ in the 2013-14 fiscal year \x97 barely enough to cover just the country´s defence\
  \ expenditure of $7 billion.The finance ministry is aiming to boost the tax-to-GDP\
  \ ratio to 15 percent in the current fiscal year ending June 30.As part of those\
  \ efforts, the FBR is compiling lifestyle and vehicle data to try to trace unregistered\
  \ taxpayers, including wealthy landlords and businessmen zipping between their luxury\
  \ homes in imported Mercedes.\"We are collecting information from the vehicle registration\
  \ authority, car manufacturers, utility companies, telecom companies and property\
  \ registration offices and tracing people who are not paying any tax,\" FBR spokesman\
  \ Shahid Hussain told AFP.Taxpayer profilesThe data is used to generate profiles\
  \ of potential taxpayers, after which demands are issued for them to pay income\
  \ tax.\"FBR has already issued notices to 261,250 potential tax payers,\" Hussain\
  \ told AFP, adding that that new taxpayers have paid 570 million rupees since the\
  \ crackdown started.It is not just dodgy businessmen who have been caught \x97 several\
  \ lawmakers have been found paying either no tax or very little and not filing their\
  \ mandatory annual tax statements.The FBR has taken punitive measures against some\
  \ \"chronic defaulters\", freezing nearly 300 bank accounts, seizing more than 100\
  \ vehicles, putting 78 properties up for sale and issuing arrest warrants in 40\
  \ cases.\"Employing information technology, the FBR is creating a central database\
  \ which would contain information about all taxpayers and nobody will be left undetected,\"\
  \ Hussain said.A new FBR department tasked with broadening the tax net started working\
  \ in July 2013 and within one year it started showing results, he added.But Pakistan\
  \ is a country where wealth and political influence go hand in hand. For generations,\
  \ landowners and industrialists have given patronage to political parties and scant\
  \ attention has been paid to their assets by the taxman.Changing this privileged\
  \ arrangement is a tricky proposition.Umar Cheema, an investigative journalist for\
  \ Pakistani daily The News who has done several major exposes on tax-dodgers, says\
  \ the FBR´s commitment is encouraging, but he does not expect them to net any big\
  \ fish.´War on tax cheats´\"FBR is after those who can´t influence them,\" Cheema\
  \ told AFP, citing several well-known tycoons considered among Pakistan´s richest\
  \ whose names were missing from a list of the country´s top 100 taxpayers.\"It can\
  \ be done only by waging a war against tax cheaters without discrimination of good\
  \ and bad cheaters,\" Cheema said.Pakistan´s central bank said in a recent report\
  \ that tax revenue growth was not keeping up with budget targets.The tax take grew\
  \ 11.7 percent in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, against an annual\
  \ target of 26.9 percent \x97 but this was only half the growth of the same period\
  \ during the previous fiscal year, according to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).The\
  \ central bank has urged the government to simplify tax procedures and do more to\
  \ increase the documentation of the economy.A vast amount of business in Pakistan\
  \ is done off the books, making transactions hard to trace and levy dues on.\"Although\
  \ FBR has taken a number of measures to increase tax collection, these focused more\
  \ on deductions at source, and/or increasing the tax rates,\" a recent SBP report\
  \ said, warning such measures had enjoyed \"limited success\" in the past.The IMF,\
  \ though, has said the government´s reform programme \x97 tied to a $6.6 billion\
  \ loan from the Washington-based lender \x97 was on track, and expects growth to\
  \ accelerate to 4.3 percent in the 2014-15 fiscal year from 4.1 percent previously.But\
  \ even with growth quickening and officials insisting they are making inroads, challenges\
  \ to the government´s efforts to gather taxes remain considerable.             \
