  Speculators are exercising some caution ahead of the official supply data today.\"\
  Later on Wednesday, the US government´s Department of Energy will publish its weekly\

  \ to report stockpiles fell by two million barrels in the week ending May 15, according\
  \ to Bloomberg News. They still remain near their highest levels on record, however.\"\
  Although stockpiles are expected to fall, the crude production level in the US is\
  \ still on a high side and we expect it to rise further,\" said Daniel Ang, an investment\
  \ analyst with Phillip Futures in Singapore.Both oil contracts fell sharply Tuesday\
  \ on worries about the crude oversupply and as the greenback soared against other\
  \ major currencies, making dollar-priced oil more expensive and denting demand.The\
  \ dollar strengthened against the euro after a European Central Bank official said\
  \ the bank would ramp up its asset-purchase stimulus programme in May and June to\
  \ offset an expected financial market slowdown in the coming months.A robust report\
  \ on US housing construction also lifted the greenback.\"The strengthening of the\
  \ dollar... was the reason for the three percent decline in crude prices yesterday,\"\
  \ added Ang.\"The subsequent rebound we see today is due to bargain-hunting and\
  \ the market forces readjusting to normal trading.\" (AFP)                     \
