content: "MILAN: Milan\x92s Expo 2015 opened on Friday with hopes the six-month food-themed\
  \ world fair will be a catalyst for economic revival competing with fears it will\
  \ simply underline Italy\x92s deep-seated problems.The first global exhibition since\
  \ Shanghai´s groundbreaking hosting five years ago has been beset by delays and\
  \ the site was far from fully completed as the first visitors streamed in at 0800\
  \ GMT.Corruption scandals, fears of violent protests and evidence of a fledgling\
  \ economic recovery running out of steam have all dampened the mood in the run-up\
  \ to the event.But Italy is a master at delivering at the 11th hour -- the finishing\
  \ touches to some of the stadiums for the 1990 World Cup came within minutes of\
  \ kick-off.And a spectacular eve-of-opening concert, featuring tenor Andrea Bocelli,\
  \ Chinese pianist Lang Lang and the choir and opera of the city´s renowned La Scala\
  \ opera house performing in front of Milan´s magnificent Gothic cathedral, was a\
  \ reminder of the country´s capacity to compensate with creativity for its shortcomings\
  \ in the more humdrum aspects of event planning.Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has\
  \ been bullishly predicting that it will all be alright on the night, facing down\
  \ the opponents who say a state with Italy´s unsustainable debt should not be ploughing\
  \ money into an event that is, by definition, ephemeral in nature.Those opponents\
  \ are due to stage a major march on Friday and fears of a spillover into violence\
  \ were raised by incidents on the eve of the opening, when a few dozen masked protestors\
  \ attempted to spray-paint and smash the windows of a branch of Manpower, an employment\
  \ agency that is one of the official partners of the Expo.- Milan seeking reinvention\
  \ -Italy secured the rights to host the Expo seven years ago, long before Renzi\
  \ came to power last year. But he has embraced it as an opportunity for Italy to\
  \ show the world that it is reinventing itself under his leadership.The event plays\
  \ to Italy´s strengths with its nutrition and gastronomy-based theme of \"Feeding\
  \ the Planet, Energy for Life.\"Organisers are predicting 20 million visitors over\
  \ six months and a 10-billion-euro boost to economic activity through increased\
  \ tourist revenues and other, harder to measure, benefits such as increased investment.More\
  \ than a million Chinese are expected to visit Milan for the Expo and Italian officials\
  \ are hoping some of them will become long-term business partners as the economic\
  \ relationship between the two countries flourishes.For Milan, the Expo is also\
  \ about reinvention with the city seeking to forge a new image as a 21st Century\
  \ \"smart\" city that is defined as much by its flair for gastronomy, design and\
  \ sustainable living as by its industrial past.There will be tight airport-style\
  \ security around the site and a huge police presence on Friday in anticipation\
  \ of the \"No Expo\" movement´s march.Earlier this week, police carried out pre-emptive\
  \ raids on radical groups suspected of planning to ensure the demonstration turns\
  \ into a showdown with the security forces.Officers seized fireworks, baseball bats,\
  \ gas masks and material which could be used to make Molotov cocktails.The organisers\
  \ of Friday´s demonstration have insisted it will be peaceful and accuse the police\
  \ and media of whipping up public alarm because they are fearful that there will\
  \ be more people protesting than visiting the Expo.The Expo´s critics have focused\
  \ on the conditions of some of the 6,000 employees who have been engaged on a work\
  \ experience basis, as well as the involvement of corporations such as McDonalds\
  \ and Coca Cola, saying that has stripped the event of any environmental credibility.\
