  \ report, which showed US crude stockpiles hit a fresh record last week.\"US crude\
  \ oil (prices) posted a rebound... after plunging 5.5 percent the previous day as\
  \ rising US inventories countered expectations for recovering demand,\" said ETX\
  \ Capital analyst David Papier.WTI sank $2.82 in New York on Thursday while Brent\
  \ shed $1.58 in London, in a delayed reaction by traders to a bigger-than-expected\
  \ 9.4 million barrels increase in US crude stocks in the week to February 20.The\
  \ US Department of Energy said Wednesday US crude reserves now stand at a record\
  \ 434.1 million barrels.Surging American oil reserves normally weigh on prices because\

  \ managed to get some support amid positive comments from OPEC´s kingpin Saudi Arabia´s\
  \ Al-Naimi, who said prices were stabilising and that demand was growing,\" said\
