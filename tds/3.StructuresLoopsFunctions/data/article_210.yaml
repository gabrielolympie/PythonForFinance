content: "LONDON: Oil prices rose Tuesday as markets weighed the effects of Iran´s\
  \ deal with six world powers on curbing the Islamic republic´s suspected ambitions\
  \ for a nuclear bomb.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for August delivery gained\
  \ 84 cents at $53.04 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.European benchmark\
  \ Brent oil for August delivery added 66 cents at $58.51 a barrel in London. \"\
  I think people had already sold down the price of oil, expecting an agreement,\"\
  \ said Michael Lynch, an analyst with the US-based consultancy Strategic Energy\
  \ & Economic Research. \"So it´s a case of selling on the rumour and buying on the\
  \ news.\"\"Now that it´s actually happened, people are buying back in,\" Lynch said.Analysts\
  \ said the landmark agreement that will see sanctions eventually lifted on Iran´s\
  \ oil exports would help to put a lid on any rise in crude futures this year and\
  \ in the future.\"To be clear, the return of Iranian oil exports over the next year\
  \ is one factor likely to keep oil prices low,\" said Thomas Pugh, commodities economist\
  \ at consultants Capital Economics.Historic dealMajor powers -- Britain, China,\
  \ France, Germany, Russia and the United States -- clinched a historic deal Tuesday\
  \ aimed at ensuring Iran does not obtain the nuclear bomb, opening up Tehran´s stricken\
  \ economy and potentially ending decades of bad blood with the West.Reached on day\
  \ 18 of marathon talks in Vienna, the accord is aimed at resolving a 13-year standoff\
  \ over Iran´s nuclear ambitions after repeated diplomatic failures and threats of\
  \ military action.The deal puts strict limits on Iran´s nuclear activities for at\
  \ least a decade and calls for stringent UN oversight, with world powers hoping\
  \ that this will make any dash to make an atomic bomb virtually impossible.In return,\
  \ painful international sanctions that have slashed the oil exports of OPEC´s fifth-largest\
  \ producer and choked its economy will be lifted and billions of dollars in frozen\
  \ assets unblocked.However, analysts cautioned that it will take time for additional\
  \ Iranian oil to hit markets.\"Iranian crude oil production is likely to increase\
  \ in 2016 but will take a number of years to reach its previous peak,\" Fitch Ratings\
  \ said in a client note on Tuesday.\"Iran´s oil exports at the moment are around\
  \ 1.1 million barrels per day versus levels of around 2.5 million before 2012,\"\
  \ it noted.The ratings agency added: \"We would expect to see some increases in\
  \ production throughout the course of 2016 but that this would be less than half\
  \ of the full 1.4 million barrels daily that was lost.\"The remainder will require\
  \ significant investment and expertise, for which Iran is likely to want to partner\
  \ with international oil companies.\"A spokesperson for Royal Dutch Shell said the\
  \ energy giant is \"interested in exploring the role Shell can play in developing\
  \ Iran´s energy potential\".BP added in a statement: \"We are watching the situation\
  \ and in the meantime we continue to comply with sanctions. We will look at opportunities\
  \ once able to do so.\"Lid on pricesLooking ahead, \"the extent of the impact on\
  \ oil prices will depend primarily on the domestic capability to get oil on the\
  \ market\", said Nina Skero, economist at the Centre for Economics and Business\
  \ Research.\"We expect Brent crude to... trade around $60 per barrel for the remainder\
  \ of the year,\" she added.World oil prices collapsed by 60 per cent between June\
  \ 2014 and January when it hit a low of $45. This in part was owing to excessive\
  \ supplies caused by the boom in US shale oil.While OPEC on Monday revised upward\
  \ its forecast for global crude oil demand growth for this year, it warned that\
  \ crude output would also continue to increase.Iran´s OPEC peers Saudi Arabia and\
  \ Iraq \"have both significantly ramped up production this year\", noted Richard\
  \ Mallinson, analyst at research group Energy Aspects.\"There is little chance that\
  \ these countries, and other OPEC members, are going to reduce output to make space\
  \ for a return of Iranian production,\" he told AFP.                        \r\n\
