content: "KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Thursday stressed upon removing\
  \ structural rigidities of various economic sectors, especially the export sector,\
  \ in order to shift reliance from debt inflows for the financing of current account\
  \ deficit and building up of foreign exchange reserves.\x93The first and foremost,\
  \ exports, the prime source of foreign exchange earnings for the country, have been\
  \ stagnant in the recent past, and declined during July-March (period) of FY15,\x94\
  \ the central bank said in its latest report covering economic performance during\
  \ the third quarter (January-March 2015) of the last fiscal year that ended on June\
  \ 30, 2015.The report emphasized that as the non-debt inflows remained subdued,\
  \ the country has to rely on debt inflows for the financing of current account deficit,\
  \ and building up of liquid FX reserves.Moreover, it said net foreign direct investment\
  \ (FDI) inflows, though maintained the last year\x92s level, could not match the\
  \ outflow under repatriation of profits/dividends while the modest growth in tax\
  \ collections continued to be a challenge.Referring to the external sector, it said\
  \ the sector improved considerably due to (a) the current account, benefiting from\
  \ a robust growth in workers\x92 remittances, higher inflows under Coalition Support\
  \ Fund, and a sharp reduction in oil prices, posted a notable surplus in Q3-FY15;\
  \ and (b) the SBP\x92s liquid FX reserves more than doubled the level seen a year\
  \ ago, enough to finance three months of the country\x92s import bill.The resulting\
  \ stability in the exchange rate, together with the government decision to pass-on\
  \ the benefit of fall in international oil prices to domestic consumers and the\
  \ prudent monetary management, not only pushed YoY CPI inflation down to a decade\x92\
  s low.The report added that the budget deficit during July-March FY15 slightly narrowed\
  \ to 3.8 percent of GDP, compared with 3.9 percent in the same period last year.\
  \ FBR tax collections grew by 12.7 percent during Jul-Mar FY15, which were well\
  \ below the 17.9 percent growth recorded in Jul-Mar FY14. Overall expenditures grew\
  \ by 8.3 percent during Jul-Mar FY15, against 8.7 percent in the same period FY14.\
  \ According to the report, the financing of budget deficit indicates that the government\
  \ did not resort to inflationary borrowing from SBP; instead, it returned a huge\
  \ sum of Rs 674.4 billion (on cash basis) during July-March FY15.As a result, the\
  \ government was not only able to contain its borrowing from SBP within the IMF\
  \ ceiling for end-March 2015, but also met the limit of zero quarterly borrowing\
  \ prescribed in the SBP Act, 1956.The report also noted that the real GDP grew by\
  \ 4.24 percent in FY15. Though it was the highest since FY08, it fell short of 5.1\
  \ percent target for the year, as most of the challenges to economic activity continued\
  \ to persist. Agriculture sector posted a slightly higher growth (2.9 percent) in\
  \ FY15, compared with 2.7 percent in FY14. Large scale manufacturing (LSM) grew\
  \ by 2.5 percent during Jul-Mar FY15, compared with the 4.6 percent growth during\
  \ the same period last year. Despite relatively low growth in commodity producing\
  \ sectors (agriculture and industry), services managed to grow by 5.0 percent in\
  \ FY15, which was higher than 4.4 percent of last year. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
