  \ Agency (IEA) predicted that global oil prices will recover only partially over\
  \ the next five years, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI)\
  \ for March delivery slipped 74 cents to $52.12, while Brent crude for March eased\
  \ 77 cents to $57.57 in afternoon trade. Citing a major shakeup in the oil markets,\
  \ the IEA said in its five-year forecast that prices will recover from current levels\
  \ of around $50-60 per barrel but remain considerably below the more than $100 price\
  \ tags reached the slump began in June.\"The global oil market looks set to begin\
  \ a new chapter of its history, with markedly changing demand dynamics, sweeping\
  \ shifts in crude trade and product supply, and dramatically different roles for\
  \ OPEC and non-OPEC producers in regulating upstream supply,\" the IEA said.It added\
  \ that it sees market rebalancing occurring \"relatively swiftly\", with increases\
  \ in inventories halting mid-year and the market tightening.\"This morningÂ´s slight\
  \ dip is likely due to the IEA report that predicts only a slow recovery for oil\
  \ prices. However this is only in the short term as the market fundamentals have\
  \ not changed,\" said Shailaja Nair, associate editorial director at energy information\
  \ provider Platts.Prices have plunged from their mid-2014 peaks largely owing to\
  \ a surge in global reserves boosted by robust US shale production and weak global\
  \ demand. (AFP)                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
