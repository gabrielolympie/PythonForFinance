content: "Shanghai: China´s central bank on Tuesday devalued its yuan currency by\
  \ nearly two percent against the US dollar, as authorities seek to push market reforms\
  \ and bolster the world´s second-largest economy.The surprise move marked the biggest\
  \ drop since China reformed its currency system in 2005 by unpegging the yuan --\
  \ also known as the renminbi (RMB) -- from the greenback.It should make the country´s\
  \ exports more competitive overseas, but analysts said it could prompt anger in\
  \ the US.The People´s Bank of China (PBoC) set its daily reference rate for the\
  \ yuan at 6.2298 to $1, compared with 6.1162 yuan the previous day, effectively\
  \ 1.86 percent lower.The change came amid speculation China is preparing to widen\
  \ the yuan´s two percent trading band for the first time since March 2014.The range\
  \ is calculated from a central \"reference rate\" each day. Before Tuesday, Chinese\
  \ officials said they based the fixing on a poll of market-makers, but the PBoC´s\
  \ move means it will now also take into account the previous day´s close and other\
  \ factors.Beijing has so far kept a tight grip on the currency´s value on fears\
  \ major swings and volatile capital flows could present financial risk and reduce\
  \ its control over the economy.That has made the yuan far more stable than other\
  \ major global currencies and a two percent move in its value is dramatic -- before\
  \ Tuesday´s announcement it had traded within a roughly 0.4 percent band for four\
  \ months. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
