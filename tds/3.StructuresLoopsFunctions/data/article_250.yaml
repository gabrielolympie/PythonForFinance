content: "WASHINGTON: Suddenly the online news business is red-hot. Money is flowing\
  \ into digital news ventures at an unprecedented pace, as investors anticipate an\
  \ accelerating shift away from traditional media, and new ways to generate revenue\
  \ from news.BuzzFeed made news this past week with a $200 million capital injection\
  \ from Comcast´s NBCUniversal, and with the announcement of a joint venture with\
  \ Yahoo Japan for Japanese readers.Earlier this month, Vox Media also secured $200\
  \ million from NBCU as the startup seeks to ramp up its news websites including\
  \ Vox.com, The Verge, Re/code and Bleacher Report.Vox and BuzzFeed joined the club\
  \ of \"unicorns,\" or venture-funded startups worth at least $1 billion, a group\
  \ which also includes Vice Media, which unveiled a $500 million funding round last\
  \ year.The flood of capital to the sector suggests confidence in the ability of\
  \ digital media to connect with readers -- especially younger audiences which eschew\
  \ traditional media -- and generate profits, say analysts.\"Right now it´s an arms\
  \ race. These are companies growing quickly and they have to grow quickly,\" said\
  \ Ken Doctor, a media analyst with the research firm Outsell.Doctor said a key for\
  \ these organization is capturing the attention of \"millennials,\" or young adults\
  \ born after 1980 who rarely subscribe to print publications or cable television,\
  \ and who get most of their content online.\"Marketers have discovered the millennial\
  \ generation as they get more earning power,\" he told AFP.Interestingly, much of\
  \ the money flowing into these organizations is coming from traditional media, seeking\
  \ fresh ways to deal with a transition to digital news.The Murdoch family´s 21st\
  \ Century Fox is an investor in Vice Media, for example, while Time Warner has invested\
  \ in the online news site Mashable.\"It´s as much a hedge as anything else,\" Doctor\
  \ said.\"It´s a lot of money but not a bank-breaking amount.\"Digital eats everything\
  \ The analyst added that big media groups which saw troubles for print a decade\
  \ ago are now waking up to digital disruption of television.With consumers slowly\
  \ moving away from cable TV bundles, \"you can see the fault lines,\" Doctor said.\
  \ \"Digital eats everything, and television is not immune.\"The more successful\
  \ media startups have found ways to connect and use technology better than legacy\
  \ firms, say some analysts.\"BuzzFeed and Vox and other high-profile startups make\
  \ the claim they are not just content companies, they are tech companies,\" says\
  \ Nikki Usher Layser, a journalism professor at George Washington University specializing\
  \ in digital media.This means \"using data science to understand how information\
  \ is spreading\" and being shared, she said, to better adapt news feeds and enable\
  \ advertisers to reach specific segments of readers.BuzzFeed is known for using\
  \ technology to help understand how news goes viral, while Mashable uses its own\
  \ system for this. AOL, which owns news sites such as The Huffington Post and TechCrunch,\
  \ is known for ad technology which measures effectiveness of online messages. Old,\
  \ new media mergeRebecca Lieb, an independent media analyst and consultant, said\
  \ she sees benefits from bringing old and new media together.Comcast´s NBC can reach\
  \ young audiences by sharing video from programming including the Olympic Games.\"\
  We´re seeing an era of declining television viewership and increased cord cutting,\"\
  \ she told AFP.\"We have a large number of millennials who are never going to sign\
  \ up for television packages so I´m sure NBC is hoping that BuzzFeed can help drive\
  \ new audiences.\"For journalism, the good news is that this trend is driving investment\
  \ in content, which means more hiring and in-depth reporting at a time when traditional\
  \ newsroom job losses are accelerating.These large venture-funded news groups have\
  \ been adding staff, along with smaller ones like Ozy, Fusion and Vocativ. Additionally,\
  \ eBay founder Pierre Omidyar has pledged to invest $250 million in his online news\
  \ operations, which include investigative site The Intercept.Doctor said most new\
  \ media groups spend 60 to 70 percent of their budgets on news and content compared\
  \ with just 12 percent for the newspaper industry.\"These companies have a belief\
  \ that good content and appropriate content is a business driver,\" Doctor said.Still,\
  \ it remains unclear if the companies are seeing an investment bubble which gives\
  \ them unjustifiably high valuations.\"We have seen scant evidence of actual return\
  \ of money to investors,\" Layser said. \"We have not seen a magic bullet that is\
  \ going to make a clear pathway to profitability.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
