content: "NEW YORK: US authorities are investigating the credit rating agency Moody's\
  \ over its glowing assessments of mortgage deals in the runup to the 2008 financial\
  \ crisis, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday.Citing people familiar with the\
  \ situation, the newspaper said Justice Department officials had met with several\
  \ former Moody's executives. It wasn't yet clear if the probe would result in a\
  \ lawsuit.If the investigation is confirmed, Moody's would become the second major\
  \ US credit-rating firm in the Justice Department's crosshairs, after a case against\
  \ Standard & Poor's.S&P is expected to within days agree to pay $1.37 billion to\
  \ settle lawsuits over its rosy grading of mortgage bonds in the financial crisis,\
  \ sources told AFP.Neither Moody's nor the Justice Department were immediately reachable\
  \ for comment Sunday.US authorities are probing whether the firm compromised its\
  \ standards to score deals, the Journal reported, and the focus is on residential\
  \ mortgage deals from about 2004 to 2007.Positive ratings on what turned out to\
  \ be extremely risky mortgage deals, known as subprime loans, were a main cause\
  \ of the 2008 financial collapse.Investors rely on rating firms' grades to assess\
  \ risk.Numerous banks have already paid huge fines and settlements for their roles\
  \ in packaging and selling the bonds as low-risk, solid investments. \r\n\r\n\r\n\
