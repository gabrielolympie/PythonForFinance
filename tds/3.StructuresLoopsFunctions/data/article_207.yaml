content: "NEW YORK: The euro surged against the dollar Friday amid hope that European\
  \ leaders would accept Greece´s proposals for a new bailout deal over the weekend.The\
  \ proposal, in which Athens offered signficant reforms over the next three years\
  \ in exchange for fresh money and restructured debts from the country´s official\
  \ EU creditors, raised optimism that another default by Greece and its exit from\
  \ the euro area could be avoided.The euro rose more than one cent to $1.1149 around\
  \ 2100 GMT on Friday. It also surged nearly three yen to 136.86 yen.\"The current\
  \ proposals set forth by Greece and the creditors should have enough common ground\
  \ that an agreement can be reached before the negotiation deadline on Sunday,\"\
  \ said Christopher Vecchio, an analyst at DailyFX.The greenback showed little effect\
  \ from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen´s reiteration that the Fed´s first rate\
  \ hike since 2006 will likely come before the end of the year.Yellen though remained\
  \ cautious -- reflecting sentiment from the last Fed policy meeting -- noting continuing\
  \ signs of slack in the jobs market and the risk of moving too soon on rates.\"\
  We will be watching carefully to see if there is continued improvement in labor\
  \ market conditions, and we will need to be reasonably confident that inflation\
  \ will move back to two percent in the next few years,\" she said.             \
