  \ over growing US stockpiles and after OPEC warned of a stubborn global supply glut,\
  \ analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for April delivery slid\
  \ to $42.63 a barrel -- touching the lowest level since March 11, 2009. It later\
  \ stood at $42.70, down $1.18 from Monday´s close.Nearing midday in London, European\
  \ benchmark Brent North Sea crude for May delivery fell $1.14 to $52.80 a barrel.Crude\
  \ futures also dropped Monday on worries over growing US oil inventories, which\
  \ already stand at record-high levels adding to the global oversupply.In addition,\
  \ the market fell sharply after OPEC questioned the strength of last month´s rally,\
  \ saying in a report that the price increase came \"despite the fact that global\
  \ supply continued to exceed demand\".Traders are now eagerly awaiting Wednesday´s\
  \ weekly US government report on crude reserves for the week to March 13.\"Growing\
  \ concerns that US crude stockpiles would see additional builds this week pushed\
  \ prices lower,\" said Sucden analyst Kash Kamal.A Bloomberg News survey showed\
  \ US crude stockpiles are expected to have increased by 3.3 million barrels to 452.2\
  \ million last week.US crude stockpiles have risen for nine weeks in a row to reach\
  \ a record 448.9 million barrels on March 6.Singapore´s United Overseas Bank said\
  \ the recent price decline was due to \"concerns that US crude supplies are at record\
  \ levels and continue to build up\".World oil prices have collapsed by more than\
  \ half since June last year on mounting US supplies, weak global economic growth\
  \ and OPEC´s decision to keep output high despite falling prices.Leading US energy\
  \ producers have curtailed some investment, resulting in lower weekly rig counts.Despite\
  \ the reduced drilling, Goldman Sachs estimated Monday that US output would still\
  \ grow by 230,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with a year\
