content: "KARACHI: State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor on Thursday urged the country´s\
  \ Islamic banks to develop ways to reward their customers in line with a surge in\
  \ the sector´s profitability, or face regulatory action. Islamic finance is experiencing\
  \ a revival in Pakistan, aided by an ambitious five-year plan that regulators hope\
  \ will double the industry´s share of the banking sector to 20 percent by 2020.A\
  \ growing client base and improving asset quality helped Islamic banks post profits\
  \ before tax of 12 billion rupees ($119.1 million) in the third quarter of last\
  \ year, almost double the year-earlier amount, central bank data shows. But regulators\
  \ want to tackle consumer perceptions that Islamic banks falter when it comes to\
  \ social responsibility and ethical banking practices.The average financing-to-deposit\
  \ spread - the difference between what banks charge for financing and what they\
  \ pay their depositors - for all lenders, Islamic and conventional, remains high\
  \ and should be \"reasonably rationalised\", central bank governor Ashraf Wathra\
  \ said in a speech to a gathering of industry executives on Monday. He did not specify\
  \ a satisfactory level, but singled out Islamic banks as the ones needing to reward\
  \ customers in line with a rise in profits.\"Banks were advised to come up with\
  \ their own solutions or the SBP will apply sharia-compliant measures to address\
  \ the issue,\" said Wathra. He did not elaborate, but in the past the central bank\
  \ has prescribed minimum targets for banks to lend to specific sectors of the economy\
  \ such as agriculture and small business. Islamic banks follow religious principles\
  \ which ban the charging of interest and gambling, and stress the sharing of risk\
  \ and profits. The industry has developed a range of sharia-compliant financial\
  \ tools, some with greater profit-sharing qualities than others. Islamic banks fall\
  \ short when it comes to using strongly profit-sharing instruments such as musharaka,\
  \ whose share of overall Islamic financing in Pakistan was only 10.1 percent as\
  \ of September, compared to 4.2 percent a year earlier. Musharaka is a partnership\
  \ in which two or more parties agree to provide capital, sharing both profits and\
  \ losses according to a stipulated ratio. By contrast, murabaha - a cost-plus-profit\
  \ arrangement where one party agrees to buy merchandise for another - commands the\
  \ lion´s share of financing by the country´s Islamic banks, at 30.3 percent. Murabaha\
  \ is often criticised for lacking economic substance and its resemblance to a conventional\
  \ loan. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
