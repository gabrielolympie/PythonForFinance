content: "London: Oil prices slid Monday, extending last week´s sharp decline as the\
  \ dollar strengthens on eurozone strains and record supplies in the United States\
  \ add further downward pressure.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery\
  \ in April shed $1.17 to $49.64 a barrel compared with Friday´s close.Brent North\
  \ Sea crude for April lost $1.24 to stand at $58.98 in London afternoon deals.WTI\
  \ slumped 4.66 percent and Brent tumbled 2.1 percent during the week to last Friday.\"\
  Crude oil prices extended declines (Monday)... as investors remained cautious following\
  \ the ongoing uncertainty in the eurozone, while the strong US dollar currently\
  \ weighed on market sentiment,\" said Myrto Sokou, senior research analyst at Sucden\
  \ brokers.\"Crude oil inventories continue to remain fairly high, following sharp\
  \ builds of crude oil stocks in the last few weeks. The continuous large increases\
  \ of crude inventories verify a possible slowdown of US oil demand,\" she added.Globally,\
  \ crude supplies are being boosted after oil fields in eastern Libya resumed pumping\
  \ to the Hariga port after a pipeline was repaired, Bloomberg News reported.And\
  \ Oman, the biggest Middle East producer outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting\
  \ Countries, plans to ramp up output to 980,000 barrels a day this year.Crude prices\
  \ lost around 60 percent of their value between June and late January owing to an\
  \ oversupply in world markets, a weak global economy and a strong dollar that made\
  \ oil expensive to purchase for holders of rival currencies.The euro continued to\
  \ be pressured by the dollar Monday despite eurozone ministers tentatively agreeing\
  \ to extend Greece´s bailout by four months.While oil prices have won support in\
  \ recent weeks on a decline in operating US oil rigs and as energy giants cut investment,\
  \ markets-watchers say volatility is likely to continue for some time.Daniel Ang,\
  \ an investment analyst with Phillip Futures in Singapore, said a sustained rebound\
  \ for oil prices was unlikely because of a global oversupply of the commodity, noting\
  \ that US crude production has remained strong at above 9.2 million barrels per\
  \ day.He said a strike in US oil refineries has led to an excess of crude in the\
  \ American market as less of the product is being sent to the facilities for refining.Workers\
  \ at three major US oil refineries operated with Royal Dutch Shell went on strike\
  \ on Saturday in a dispute over safer working conditions, the United Steelworkers\
  \ (USW) union said.About 1,350 employees in three refineries and chemical plants\
  \ are affected by the latest strike action, which mirrored walkouts on other sites\
  \ launched earlier this month. (AFP)                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
