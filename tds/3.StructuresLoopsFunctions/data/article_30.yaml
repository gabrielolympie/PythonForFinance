content: "London: Global oil prices slid Wednesday following a three-day rally as\
  \ dealers were divided on whether the commodity has bottomed out after a plunge\
  \ of nearly 60 percent since June. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for\
  \ delivery in March shed $1.72 to stand at $51.33 a barrel compared with TuesdayÂ´s\
  \ close.Brent North Sea crude for March slid $1.15 a barrel to trade at $56.76 in\
  \ London afternoon trade.WTI had soared $3.48 Tuesday to record its highest finish\
  \ since December 31, while Brent jumped $3.16 to a similar closing peak, as dealers\
  \ cheered signs that the oil industry is tightening exploration activities to cap\
  \ a supply glut.Ken Hasegawa, an energy trading manager at Newedge Group in Tokyo,\
  \ said the crude market was \"extremely volatile\" after the three-day rally that\
  \ began Friday saw prices surge nearly 20 percent.\"It has become increasingly difficult\
  \ to discern the direction of the prices of crude oil, but the fundamentals remain\
  \ unchanged,\" Hasegawa told AFP. He added that prices could \"fluctuate by increasing\
  \ up to $10 and falling up to $10\" in the short term.Deep cuts in capital spending\
  \ by major oil companies, including new announcements Tuesday by BP and BG Group,\
  \ had suggested there would be tighter supplies in the future. The Baker Hughes\
  \ North America rig count report for the week to January 30 showed a drop of 128\
  \ rigs to 1,937. That compared with 2,393 a year ago.Some analysts however remain\
  \ doubtful that the current oil price rebound will be sustained as supplies still\
  \ outweigh demand in the immediate term.The oil market has lost more than half its\
  \ value since June largely owing to a surge in global reserves boosted by robust\
  \ US shale oil production. The problem was exacerbated in November after OPEC decided\
  \ to maintain output levels despite plunging prices.The 12-nation Organization of\
  \ Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cartel pumps about 30 percent of global crude\
  \ supplies. (AFP)                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
