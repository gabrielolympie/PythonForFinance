content: "Singapore: Oil prices fell in Asia Tuesday as dealers focused on an upcoming\
  \ US energy report for clues about production and demand levels in the world´s top\
  \ crude consumer amid abundant global supplies.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate\
  \ for September delivery fell 47 cents to $44.49 while Brent crude for September\
  \ eased 45 cents to $49.96 in mid-morning trade.The US Energy Information Administration\
  \ will release the latest US stockpiles report for the week to August 7 on Wednesday.Analysts\
  \ said dealers will focus on production after it rose 52,000 in the previous week,\
  \ slightly offsetting a 4.4 million drop in overall crude reserves that indicated\
  \ healthy demand.London-based research house Capital Economics said the main drivers\
  \ pressuring oil prices were \"signs of a recovery in US production and buoyant\
  \ OPEC supply\".Dealers predict a slowdown in US output -- and increased demand\
  \ during the summer driving season -- could whittle down a huge global glut that\
  \ has been a key reason prices collapsed from a peak of around $120 in June last\
  \ year.The Organisation of the Petroleum Export Countries´ (OPEC) decision to maintain\
  \ its output level at around 30 million barrels a day despite sagging demand is\
  \ also seen as a reason for the abundant supplies.The move is seen as an attempt\
  \ by the producer cartel´s kingpin Saudi Arabia to defend its market share as it\
  \ fends off competition from US shale oil.That policy may be working, with the latest\
  \ drop in prices prompting \"more Western oil companies to shelve investment plans,\
  \ which will feed back into slower growth in non-OPEC production,\" Capital Economics\
  \ said. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
