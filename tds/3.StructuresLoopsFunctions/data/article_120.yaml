content: "New York: Oil prices fell Tuesday as the Saudi-led coalition announced an\
  \ end to its military strikes in Yemen and the market expected another rise in US\
  \ crude inventories. West Texas Intermediate for May delivery sank $1.12, or two\
  \ percent, to close at $55.26 a barrel on its last day the contract´s trade on the\
  \ New York Mercantile Exchange.Brent North Sea crude for June delivery, the global\
  \ benchmark, settled at $62.08 a barrel in London trade, down $1.37 (2.2 percent)\
  \ from Monday´s closing level.News of the Saudi-led coalition wrapping up air strikes\
  \ against rebels in Yemen, coming in afternoon trade in New York, accelerated losses\
  \ on the market, said Phil Flynn of Price Futures Group.\"Oil is selling because\
  \ the Saudis are going to end their operation in Yemen,\" Flynn said. \"This is\
  \ why we´ve seen the precipitous drop in prices in the last few minutes.\"The end\
  \ of four weeks of air strikes against the Huthi rebel forces, with the coalition\
  \ saying the rebels´ threat to Saudi Arabia and neighboring countries had been removed,\
  \ eased concerns about the spreading unrest in Yemen.Although Yemen is not a particularly\
  \ important oil producer, market watchers have been worried about the impact of\
  \ the turmoil on the oil-rich region, notably in Iran, which is suspected of supporting\
  \ the rebellion.Expectations for Wednesday´s weekly inventories report from the\
  \ US Department of Energy were bearish. The country´s historically high crude inventories\
  \ were estimated to have increased by 2.5 million barrels in the week ended April\
  \ 17, according to a Bloomberg News survey of experts.Oil prices have shed about\
  \ half their value since last June amid a supply glut and weak demand growth.For\
  \ many analysts, recent gains in oil prices were mainly the result of speculative\
  \ buying by investors betting that the fundamentals of supply and demand would improve.\
  \ News last week of a slight decline in US oil production had boosted prices.\"\
  There is no fundamental explanation for the price spike,\" Commerzbank analysts\
  \ said in a research note Tuesday. \"Due to sharply higher OPEC oil production,\
  \ the market remains significantly oversupplied.\" (AFP)                       \
