  \ in London.Data showed that US crude supplies surged 8.9 million barrels to 406.7\
  \ million in the week ending January 23, according to the US Department of Energy.That\
  \ was the highest level since the US government began keeping weekly records in\
  \ 1982. It is also above monthly data since April 1931.\"It´s not a pretty picture,\"\
  \ said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities. \"We´re seeking\
  \ bottom but I don´t think we´re there yet.\"The oil market has collapsed by more\
  \ than 50 percent since June, plagued by plentiful crude supplies, weak global demand\
  \ and the decision of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to let prices\
  \ fall.\"If proof were needed that oil prices remain constrained by too much supply,\
  \ this afternoon´s US inventory data confirmed it,\" said CMC Markets analyst Michael\
  \ Hewson.\"As such, prices could well have further to fall with prospects of a drop\
  \ below $40 a barrel becoming a reality in the short to medium term.\" (AFP)   \
