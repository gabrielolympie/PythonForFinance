content: "London: Oil prices ended the week firmer Friday, lifted by a recovery in\
  \ share prices in China, which is the world´s biggest consumer of energy and major\
  \ buyer of commodities generally.The crude market won a boost also from surging\
  \ European stock markets, that were lifted mainly by hopes of a deal between Greece\
  \ and its creditors. The International Energy Agency meanwhile forecast that global\
  \ oil demand growth would slow in 2016 and that oil production in nations outside\
  \ the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would stall.In its\
  \ first estimates for 2016, the IEA forecast that oil demand would slow next year\
  \ to 1.2 million barrels per day, compared with an average of 1.4 million barrels\
  \ per day this year.Meanwhile growth in non-OPEC oil supply \"is expected to grind\
  \ to a halt in 2016 as lower oil prices and spending cuts take a toll\", the IEA\
  \ said in its monthly oil report.In trading Friday, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate\
  \ for delivery in August climbed 42 cents to $53.20 a barrel compared with Thursday´s\
  \ close.Brent North Sea crude for August advanced 62 cents to stand at $59.23 a\
  \ barrel in London afternoon deals.- Chinese turbulence -US crude futures had sunk\
  \ nearly eight percent Monday on worries about slowing global growth, as Greek voters\
  \ rejected a bailout offer and China moved to calm financial market turbulence.\"\
  There are some signs that foreign investors are more optimistic about China´s efforts\
  \ to arrest the stock slide,\" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets.\"\
  However, I feel much caution should be exercised and it is important to observe\
  \ the Chinese markets in the coming sessions before calling it a bottom.\"Aw added:\
  \ \"As we have seen in the past, Chinese equities may recover in one session, only\
  \ to fall straight back into a downward spiral the next day.\"Chinese stocks surged\
  \ for a second day on Friday as a government rescue plan offered a respite from\
  \ a month-long rout.In a rollercoaster week, the Shanghai market gained 5.18 percent\
  \ overall, after the government announced additional policies to avoid a market\
  \ crash.But it is still down 24.9 percent from its closing peak on June 12. The\
  \ stock market slide of recent weeks was a dramatic reversal of a 150-percent charge\
  \ in the 12 months to its peak last month, fuelled by tens of millions of retail\
  \ investors using borrowed funds.China´s economy, the world´s second largest, is\
  \ already faltering. Gross domestic product expanded 7.4 percent in 2014, the slowest\
  \ pace since 1990, and weakened further in the first three months of this year.But\
  \ the International Monetary Fund said Thursday that there was no reason to lose\
  \ faith in China´s economy because of the bursting stock market bubble.-- Greek\
  \ relief --The oil market was focused also on Greece amid hopes debt-strapped nation\
  \ would reach a deal with its creditors after Athens laid out details Thursday of\
  \ a new bailout plan to save it from financial collapse.The package involves a pensions\
  \ overhaul and tax hikes in return for debt relief and a rescue loan from the eurozone.Traders\
  \ are also keeping an eye on negotiations in Vienna between western powers and Iran\
  \ on a deal to curb Tehran´s nuclear ambitions and allow the lifting of punishing\
  \ sanctions.Global powers leading the negotiations sought to ramp up the pressure\
  \ for a deal, but Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif hit back, saying\
  \ Western countries among the so-called P5+1 group on the other side of the talks\
  \ were backtracking on previous commitments.A lifting of sanctions will allow Iranian\
  \ oil to flow back into the global market, adding to a supply glut and helping depress\
  \ prices, according to analysts.Meanwhile US commercial crude stockpiles rose another\
  \ 400,000 barrels to 465.8 million barrels in the week to July 3, even as refineries\
  \ picked up activity. Gasoline inventories also jumped, with the summer holiday\
  \ driving season in full swing. (AFP)                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
