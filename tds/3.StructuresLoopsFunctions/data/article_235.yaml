  \ percent of the population pay taxes, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has set\
  \ a target to collect 138,000 more returns during the tax year 2015, officials said\
  \ on Friday. The FBR has fixed a target of 1.05 million income tax returns during\
  \ the year due to higher tax rates on non-filers. The FBR last year received 0.912\
  \ million tax returns. A senior official at Directorate of Broadening of Tax Base\
  \ (BTB) of FBR said the FBR was estimating over 100,000 new income tax returns to\
  \ be filed by the taxpayers during tax year 2015. The return filing for tax year\
  \ 2015 will be completed by December with the filing by corporate sector. The filing\
  \ of income tax returns for the tax year 2014 has been increased after measures\
  \ taken in the budget 2015/2016 and it has increased to 912,000. The total number\
  \ is still low as 3.5 million registered taxpayers are in the country. The directorate\
  \ has gathered details of transactions on which tax was paid during 2013/2014 for\
  \ the purposes of bringing new taxpayers in the system. According to details, Rs19.75\
  \ billion was collected from 2.46 million commercial and 0.29 million industrial\
  \ electricity consumers. Similarly, about Rs52 billion of taxes were collected through\
  \ withholding mechanism from 136.5 million mobile phone and 5.6 million landline\
  \ telephone subscribers. In the banking system the FBR recorded 30.5 million transactions\
  \ including saving accounts, national saving schemes and cash withdrawals on which\
  \ the tax authorities collected over Rs50 billion. The directorate so far issued\
  \ 344,572 notices to defaulters. Around 72,000 persons filed returns and paid Rs485\
  \ million tax. Through those notices, the directorate created demand of Rs16.87\
  \ billion and recovered Rs6.42 billion. During the recovery process the tax authorities\
  \ resorted to harsh measures in 2,326 cases, which included: freezing of 1,366 bank\
  \ accounts; issued arrest warrant in 343 cases; attached 195 properties and impounded\
  \ 422 vehicles. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
