  \ shortage on Tuesday said that the situation was a serious failure on the part\
  \ of OGRA (Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority) as a regulator. The committee presented\
  \ its initial findings to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in a meeting held here under\
  \ his chairmanship to review the petroleum situation in the country.The PM directed\
  \ to make structural changes to ensure that such a situation never arises again.\
  \ The meeting endorsed the earlier decision of suspending four senior officials\
  \ responsible for the crisis.The meeting also decided that Deputy Managing Director\
  \ Pakistan State Oil (PSO) Sohail Butt was also equally responsible and ordered\
  \ for his suspension as well.Meanwhile, Petroleum Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi\
  \ said that he was never satisfied with the performance of OGRA and the authority\x92\
  s performance as a regulator was not just dismal for petrol but was also same for\
  \ gas.Petrol crisis: Day 8 The petrol crisis has entered its eight day in Punjab\
  \ as commuters continue their search for fuel. Long queues are seen at stations\
  \ which are open with people complaining of waiting for several hours for just a\
  \ litre of petrol. The All Pakistan Petroleum Dealers Association said that 5.7\
  \ mn liters of petrol has been disbursed to fuel stations across Punjab during the\
  \ last three days and another 1.8 mn liters will be dispersed by tonight.However,\
  \ according to the Petroleum Dealers Association, the state of affairs is improving\
  \ and the chaos at stations was only due to mismanagement of the pumps and had nothing\
  \ to do with the supply.The association further said that all fuel stations have\
  \ been directed to meet the demands of the commuters with the provided supply of\
  \ petrol, as well as all stations should stop providing petrol to customers with\
  \ bottles and canisters in order to avoid queues. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
