  \ with investors keeping an eye on Europe as Greece struggles to pay off its debts.Tokyo\
  \ rose 0.79 percent, Hong Kong added 1.14 percent, Sydney gained 0.93 percent and\
  \ Shanghai was up 0.72 percent, while Seoul was flat.The gains reversed some of\
  \ the losses suffered on Monday that came on fears about Greece´s future in the\
  \ eurozone as Athens looks to secure billions of euros in bailout cash to pay its\
  \ enormous debts.With its creditors refusing to extend a repayment deadline while\
  \ also haggling over its bailout reforms, the Greek government has ordered all public\
  \ agencies to hand over their financial reserves.\"With this act, the government\
  \ hopes to cover urgent needs of the state amounting to three billion euros for\
  \ the next 15 days,\" said a decree, which still needs adoption by the parliament.However,\
  \ the euro held its ground in foreign exchange markets. The single currency bought\
  \ $1.0733 and 128.20 yen against $1.0741 and 128.05 yen on Wall Street.Hong Kong\
  \ and Shanghai resumed their upward trend after sharp losses Monday that came after\
  \ China´s stock market regulator tightened rules on trading with borrowed money\
  \ and increase the supply of shares for short-selling.Confidence was buoyed by Sunday´s\
  \ cut by the People´s Bank of China in the amount of cash lenders must hold in reserve,\
  \ the move aimed at helping kick-start the economy, which grew in January-March\
  \ at its slowest quarterly pace in six years. The next indicator on the state of\

  \ back.New York Fed President William C. Dudley said recent inflation data was not\
  \ strong enough to warrant an increase, even though economics growth was healthy.The\
