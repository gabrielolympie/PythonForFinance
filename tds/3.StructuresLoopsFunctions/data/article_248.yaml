content: "KARACHI: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has initiated a drive to identify\
  \ income sources of luxurious vehicles\x92 owners to ensure their tax return filings,\
  \ confiscating vehicles on non-compliance, official sources said on Thursday.The\
  \ sources said tax officials are obtaining data of registered motor vehicles above\
  \ 1,000cc to determine the sources of income of their owners to increase filings\
  \ of tax returns.They told The News that Inland Revenue asked local car assemblers\
  \ and customs authorities to share the last five-year data of purchased vehicles\
  \ with the tax department.\x93We are comparing this with the data provided by the\
  \ provincial motor vehicle registration authorities,\x94 said a source.The sources\
  \ said the FBR has started issuing notices to the owners of vehicles and around\
  \ 422 vehicles have been seized on non-compliance.Motor vehicle registration authorities\
  \ of various cities have so far shared data of 821,000 registered vehicles above\
  \ 1,000 CC, while Indus Motors Co Limited, Pak Suzuki Motors Co Ltd and Honda Atlas\
  \ Motors Ltd have provided the details of 73,200, 153,700 and 45,000 vehicles, respectively.The\
  \ sources said the customs department will also provide the details of vehicles\
  \ imported during the past five years, including those cleared under the amnesty\
  \ scheme announced in 2013.They said a number of smuggled vehicles are being used,\
  \ especially in rural areas.An official at Regional Tax Office (RTO) Karachi said\
  \ vehicles were also cleared on fake identity for which customs authorities are\
  \ responsible.The customs cleared around 51,200 vehicles under the amnesty scheme\
  \ 2013 and earned the FBR Rs16.2 billion as duty and taxes.\x93The amnesty was granted\
  \ on clearance and a vehicle owner is required to file income tax returns and declare\
  \ source of income,\x94 said the source.However, the FBR failed to identify the\
  \ real ownership due to apathy of customs department fraught with corruption and\
  \ misconduct.The Federal Tax Ombudsman, in 2014, released a detailed report on irregularities\
  \ in clearance of imported vehicles.\x93Granting amnesty to smuggling is counterproductive\
  \ as it promotes smuggling, emboldens smugglers and contributes to black economy,\x94\
  \ the report said.It further said luxury vehicles were mostly smuggled to cater\
  \ to the upper class, adding that therefore the amnesty was more undesirable and\
  \ against the national interest.\x93Apart from the conceptual irrational and counter-productivity\
  \ of amnesty for smuggled vehicles, the amnesty scheme 2013 was allegedly misused\
  \ for corrupt motives by the customs staff for regularising such vehicles as had\
  \ either not yet arrived in the country or these were not physically presented or\
  \ actually seized by the customs,\x94 the report said.Besides, many tampered and\
  \ stolen vehicles might have been granted amnesty due to weak or non-checking of\
  \ tampering and absence of any filer for stolen vehicles, it said.\x93It will be\
  \ difficult to cross-match the data of imported vehicles with those registered with\
  \ the provincial authorities in such as scenario,\x94 said a source in the Inland\
  \ Revenue. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
