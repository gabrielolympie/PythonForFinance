content: "LAHORE/ISLAMABAD: Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) stations, expected to reopen\
  \ Friday across all cities of Punjab after seven months, were still closed despite\
  \ announcements by the Punjab and Islamabad governments. The petroleum ministry's\
  \ negotiations between officials of Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) and\
  \ Compressed Natural Gas Association had earlier proved successful, with the associations\
  \ assuring that Punjab CNG stations would reopen on Friday. But CNG stations were\
  \ yet to reopen in the provincial capital Lahore, with sources saying the delay\
  \ in reopening of stations related to a dispute over clearing of dues. The SNGPL\
  \ had allowed station owners to reopen their businesses following advance payment\
  \ after the gap of almost seven months.According to sources, the SNGPL has informed\
  \ station owners to submit Rs 1.2 million as security deposit and has resumed supply\
  \ of gas to stations whose owners have paid the security amount. A similar situation\
  \ was witness in the federal capital Islamabad at the time of filing of this report.\
  \ The CNG association says the matter would be resolved and CNG stations reopened\
  \ by Friday evening.                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
