content: "NEW YORK: US oil prices Monday slipped below $50 a barrel for the first\
  \ time in more than five years as the surging dollar and news of additional supplies\
  \ extended a six-month rout.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for February delivery,\
  \ in free fall since June, ended at $50.04 a barrel, down $2.65 or five percent.\
  \ The contract got as low as $49.95 a barrel earlier in the session, its lowest\
  \ level since May 1, 2009.European benchmark Brent oil for February delivery fell\
  \ $3.31 to $53.11 a barrel in London.Monday´s slide in oil prices followed indications\
  \ of rising output from key producers Russia and Iraq at a time when forecasters\
  \ have trimmed their demand projections due to weak global economic growth.The breaching\
  \ of the psychologically important $50 level also came on a turbulent day for global\
  \ financial markets. US stocks fell nearly two percent, approaching the drops in\
  \ European equity markets as the euro plunged to a nine-year low on revived eurozone\
  \ worries.A long rally in the greenback, which gained 11 percent last year against\
  \ a basket of major currencies, has weighed on the dollar-priced oil market by making\
  \ crude more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies.Oil prices could fall\
  \ further still, analysts say.\"There´s serious concern the bottom´s not in yet,\"\
  \ said Kyle Cooper, managing partner at IAF Advisors in Houston. \"Basically everyone\
  \ who´s taken a stab at the bottom has been wrong.\"\"Oil prices attempted to stabilize\
  \ during the last two weeks, but the fundamentals remain weak,\" said Gene McGillian,\
  \ broker and analyst at Tradition Energy. \"The market is trying to come to a bottom.\
  \ It could be anybody´s guess, but it appears we still have more to go.\"Fawad Razaqzada,\
  \ a technical analyst at Forex.com., said the drop below $50 a barrel could trigger\
  \ more selling, paving the way for oil to fall as low as $45 or $40 a barrel in\
  \ the coming weeks.-Weak fundamentals-The retreat in prices comes on the heels of\
  \ a multi-year boom in US oil production that has shaken the global petroleum market\
  \ and put the US in a league with oil giants Russia and Saudi Arabia.Other leading\
  \ producers are also pumping aggressively. Iraq´s oil ministry last week released\
  \ figures showing that December crude exports reached their highest since 1980.Meanwhile,\
  \ the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has consistently ruled out\
  \ action despite the months-long slide in prices.In November, the cartel met in\
  \ Vienna and took no action, as key powerbrokers like Saudi Arabian oil minister\
  \ Ali al-Naimi said he preferred for the market to balance itself. In December,\
  \ Naimi told a Middle East publication the group would take the same hands-off approach\
  \ even if oil fell to $20 a barrel.Meanwhile, economic growth remains uncertain\
  \ in Europe and in many emerging economies, such as China and Brazil. The International\
  \ Energy Agency in December projected global crude inventories could rise by nearly\
  \ 300 million barrels in the first six months of 2015. The agency also cut its demand\
  \ outlook by more than 200,000 barrels a day for 2015.Energy equities, by far the\
  \ worst performing sector in the S&P 500 last year, suffered more pain Monday. Dow\
  \ member Chevron fell 4.0 percent, while oil-services giant Schlumberger lost 2.6\
  \ percent.Key US oil companies like ConocoPhillips and shale producer Continental\
  \ Resources have cut their drilling budgets for 2015.Still, analysts expect US output\
  \ to continue to rise this year, owing to investments that have already been made.\
  \ That will put more pressure on crude prices.\"I still think one of the primary\
  \ drivers of the market is US oil production and I really don´t see US oil production\
  \ growth slowing appreciably in the first quarter,\" Cooper said. (AFP)        \
