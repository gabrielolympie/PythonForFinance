content: "Singapore: Oil prices resumed their decline in Asia Monday as a global glut\
  \ of crude supplies showed no signs of abating in the face of sluggish demand, analysts\
  \ said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for September delivery fell 63\
  \ cents to $41.87 a barrel in late-morning trade, the lowest since March 2009. Brent\
  \ crude for October, a new contract, was down 65 cents to $48.54.WTI and Brent´s\
  \ September contract rose in New York on Friday after closing at their lowest level\
  \ in six and a half years in the prior session.But oil came under renewed pressure\
  \ in Asia after the latest data showing the number of rigs drilling for US oil increased\
  \ last week, the sixth rise in seven weeks, analysts said.The news added to fears\
  \ of a prolonged global surplus as output from the Organization of the Petroleum\
  \ Exporting Countries and the United States remains robust despite the tumbling\
  \ prices.\"The combination of elevated stockpiles in the US and increasing production\
  \ from OPEC, sluggish demand growth, and a stronger US (dollar) would continue to\
  \ pressure oil prices,\" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets in Singapore.The\
  \ dollar strengthened in Asia on Monday after solid data boosted expectations of\
  \ an imminent US rate rise, after China´s shock devaluation of the yuan last week\
  \ hurt Asia-Pacific currencies.As oil is traded in the US currency, a strong dollar\
  \ makes it more expensive for international investors, dampening demand.\"The devaluation\
  \ of the yuan by China led to the weakening of other emerging market currencies,\"\
  \ said Sanjeev Gupta, who heads the Asia-Pacific oil and gas practice at professional\
  \ services firm EY.\"This spells negative news for crude as a strong US dollar makes\
  \ crude expensive for importing countries, thereby curtailing demand.\"Gupta said\
  \ traders will be watching Chinese home prices data due for release Tuesday for\
  \ further clues on the health of the world´s second-largest economy.Traders will\
  \ also comb through the minutes of the US central bank´s meeting in late July, due\
  \ for release Wednesday, for signs on when the Fed will raise interest rates.\"\
  We continue to expect further short-term downside in WTI crude over the next few\
  \ months,\" the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) said in a market commentary.\
