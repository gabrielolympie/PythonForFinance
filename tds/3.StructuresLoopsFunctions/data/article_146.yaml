content: "London: Oil prices inched higher Thursday as a weaker dollar and an easing\
  \ supply glut offset lacklustre Chinese economic data that raised concerns about\
  \ demand in the world´s top energy consuming nation. Brent North Sea crude for delivery\
  \ in June gained 18 cents to stand at $66.99 a barrel in London afternoon trade.US\
  \ benchmark West Texas Intermediate for June delivery inched up six cents to $60.56\
  \ compared with Wednesday´s close.The euro rallied to three-month peaks against\
  \ the dollar Thursday on bright eurozone economic growth data and disappointing\
  \ US numbers, aiding demand for commodities such as oil priced in the US currency.Crude\
  \ futures won support also from official data Wednesday showing that crude US stockpiles\
  \ dropped 2.2 million barrels last week.It was the second straight week of declines,\
  \ and was much larger than the 250,000-barrel decrease expected by analysts.However,\
  \ the International Energy Agency (IEA) has said this week that a global supply\
  \ glut blamed for the recent plunge in oil prices remains as producers raise their\
  \ output to make up for a cut in US shale production.Meanwhile, \"the global demand\
  \ situation for oil is considerably weaker\" following this week´s poorly-received\
  \ economic data out of China, according to Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist\
  \ with CMC Markets in Sydney. (AFP)                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
