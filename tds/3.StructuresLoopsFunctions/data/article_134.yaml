content: "DUBAI: Gulf oil exporters must reduce spending, including subsidies, and\
  \ diversify their economies to cope with lower revenues caused by the sharp drop\
  \ in crude prices, the International Monetary Fund said.The wealthy monarchies,\
  \ however, should \"not react in a knee-jerk way to lower oil prices\", the IMF\
  \ Middle East and Central Asia chief Masood Ahmed told AFP in an interview Monday.They\
  \ would be better off to \"adjust gradually\" using the large financial reserves\
  \ they have accumulated during several years of bumper oil receipts, he said in\
  \ Dubai. But as oil prices have dropped lower than budgeted breakeven levels, \"\
  it is important that they gradually, but in a determined way... reduce their spending\
  \ (and) consolidate their fiscal position,\" Ahmed said.Oil prices have shed half\
  \ of their value since June 2014, and are expected to be lower than the breakeven\
  \ point for Gulf countries in the next three to four years.The Gulf Cooperation\
  \ Council includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab\
  \ Emirates -- economies all heavily dependent on energy revenues. A combined budget\
  \ surplus for 2014 of $76 billion (68.5 billion euros) is expected to turn into\
  \ a deficit of $113 billion this year, the IMF said in its latest regional report.\
  \ \"They need to act to reinforce their efforts to diversify their economies to\
  \ become less dependent on oil,\" said Ahmed, pointing out that many have already\
  \ taken such measures.\"The UAE is more advanced in terms of diversification. The\
  \ others also are in varying degrees trying to encourage private sector activity\
  \ outside the oil area.\" - Curb subsidies -GCC countries were also urged to cut\
  \ energy subsidies in a bid to minimise public spending and trigger a change in\
  \ consumer behaviour.\"Most GCC countries still have the domestic sale price for\
  \ energy products below the international prices... We think that over time it is\
  \ important to tackle the issue of energy subsidies to reduce them,\" Ahmed said.Gulf\
  \ states should also contain salary growth in the public sector, which usually employs\
  \ nationals as opposed to the private sector that depends on millions of foreigners.In\
  \ addition, GCC countries would need to prioritise investment projects that \"most\
  \ advance the development agenda,\" said Ahmed.Oil-export revenues for GCC countries\
  \ are forecast to be $280 billion lower this year than a year ago.With the exception\
  \ of gas-rich Qatar and Kuwait, all GCC states are expected to face budget deficits\
  \ this year, said Ahmed, adding this could persist for two or three years.\"The\
  \ important thing to recognise is that GCC countries have built up financial buffers\
  \ that put them in a very strong position to be able to use these savings to finance\
  \ expenditure and to have a gradual decrease in spending over the coming years,\"\
  \ he said.This in turn would minimise the economic impact of the drop in oil prices.\
  \ GCC states are estimated to have foreign reserves of about $2.5 trillion.\"The\
  \ impact on (economic) growth is quite limited,\" said Ahmed.The IMF has forecast\
  \ GCC countries to grow as a group at 3.4 percent in 2015, one percent down from\
  \ earlier predictions, mainly because of a slowdown in non-oil growth in response\
  \ to lower oil prices.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
