content: "London: World oil prices rebounded Friday after the International Energy\
  \ Agency declared there were signs \"the tide will turn\" following recent multi-year\
  \ lows.In early afternoon London deals, Brent North Sea crude for delivery in March\
  \ rallied $1.41 to trade at $49.68 per barrel. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate\
  \ for February gained $1.09 at $47.34.\"How low the market´s floor will be is anyone´s\
  \ guess,\" the Paris-based IEA energy watchdog said in a monthly report published\
  \ on Friday.\"A price recovery -- barring any major disruption -- may not be imminent,\
  \ but signs are mounting that the tide will turn.\"Crude futures have more than\
  \ halved since June, crashing on stubborn worries over global oversupply and weak\
  \ demand in a faltering world economy.The IEA cautioned Friday that prices were\
  \ expected to keep falling in the short-term.\"The IEA have hedged their bets somewhat\
  \ by saying the tide may turn,\" noted CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson.He added\
  \ that the \"market is very oversold and was probably due a rebound\".European benchmark\
  \ Brent had tumbled Tuesday to $45.19 per barrel, hitting the lowest level since\
  \ March 2009.The IEA added Friday that the dramatic collapse in oil prices was still\
  \ insufficient to stimulate crude consumption, because weakness in the economy has\
  \ cancelled out the benefits of cheaper crude.The agency maintained its oil demand\
  \ forecast for 2015, expecting it to grow by 0.9 million barrels a day to reach\
  \ 93.3 million barrels.The oil market rebounded Friday after plunging the previous\
  \ day on news that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had overproduced\
  \ in December, while it also cut its global demand outlook.The 12-nation OPEC cartel,\
  \ which produces about one third of global supplies, said in a monthly report Thursday\
  \ that its production rose to 30.2 million barrels a day in December, above its\
  \ 30 million limit.It also projected that demand for its oil would fall to 28.8\
  \ million barrels per day this year from 29.1 million in 2014.\"The yo-yo effect\
  \ of the crude oil prices can be attributed to the uncertainty in the market,\"\
  \ said Shailaja Nair, associate editorial director at energy information provider\
  \ Platts, pointing to an \"unstable dollar\" and an \"irregular equity market\"\
  .\"OPEC has just forecasted a drop in demand for its oil this year and this could\
  \ mean that the price rally we saw this week is unlikely to last,\" she said.Despite\
  \ the global supply glut, OPEC decided in November to maintain its collective output\
  \ ceiling at 30 million barrels of oil per day.Cartel kingpin Saudi Arabia has stated\
  \ that OPEC will not cut production even if the price drops to $20 per barrel, in\
  \ a move aimed at hurting US shale oil producers. (AFP)                        \r\
