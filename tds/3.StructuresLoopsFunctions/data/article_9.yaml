content: "SYDNEY: Oil prices fell 1 percent on Wednesday after the World Bank cut\
  \ its economic growth forecast, helping extend a rout that saw prices touch a nearly\
  \ six-year low the previous session.Oil and other commodities came under pressure\
  \ after the weaker outlook from the Washington-based financial institution reinforced\
  \ worries of a gloomy economic outlook at a time when oil markets are plagued by\
  \ oversupply.\"The global economy is running on a single engine ... the American\
  \ one,\" World Bank chief economist Kaushik Basu said. \"This does not make for\
  \ a rosy outlook for the world.\"February Brent crude LCOc1 dropped 55 cents to\
  \ $46.04 a barrel by 0927 GMT and West Texas Intermediate crude for February CLc1\
  \ was at $45.29, down 60 cents.\"There's clearly a souring of sentiment towards\
  \ industrial commodities and I think that's spilling over to oil today,\" said Michael\
  \ McCarthy, chief strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.\"Potentially this selling\
  \ is now being overdone, but today there's no sign of a turnaround,\" he said.Analysts\
  \ said prices would stay under pressure as oversupply hurts both WTI and Brent,\
  \ and a string of them have cut price forecasts for 2015 and 2016.Oil had tumbled\
  \ nearly 5 percent on Tuesday before closing down 1.8 percent, with global benchmark\
  \ Brent briefly trading at par to US prices for the first time in three months as\
  \ some traders moved to take advantage of ample US storage space.US stocks are possibly\
  \ approaching 80 percent of capacity by the upcoming spring season, according to\
  \ US-based PIRA Energy Group.Commercial crude stockpiles in the US rose 3.9 million\
  \ barrels last week, the industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) said.\
  \ The Energy Information Administration's oil inventory report is due Wednesday\
  \ at 1530 GMT.Outside the United States, some of the world's biggest oil traders\
  \ have booked supertankers to store at least 25 million barrels at sea.\"Once floating\
  \ storage starts, there is very little support on the downside for Brent spreads,\"\
  \ analysts Energy Aspects said.With oil producer club OPEC deciding late last year\
  \ to maintain its output despite slowing Asian and European economic growth, a glut\
  \ has also appeared outside the United States.\"The closing gap looks to be solidifying\
  \ Saudi Arabia's strategy to curb shale production and protect market share,\" ANZ\
  \ bank said.                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
