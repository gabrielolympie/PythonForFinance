  \ said prices are weighed down also by the euro´s fall on news that the European\
  \ Central Bank had cut off Greek banks´ access to a key source of much-needed cash.In\
  \ a decision that rattled global financial markets, the ECB said Wednesday it would\
  \ no longer allow Greek banks to use government debt, which has a junk rating, as\
  \ collateral for loans.\"The Greek situation is worth keeping an eye on as it massively\
  \ impacts the value of the euro against the US dollar,\" said Shailaja Nair, associate\
  \ editorial director at energy information provider Platts.A sinking euro makes\
  \ dollar-priced oil more expensive, denting demand and adding downward pressure\
  \ on crude prices, which have already been battered by a supply glut and weak demand.Crude\
  \ has lost more than half its value since June, when prices were at more than $100\
  \ a barrel.Global supplies have been boosted by surging US shale oil production\
  \ and a decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in November\
