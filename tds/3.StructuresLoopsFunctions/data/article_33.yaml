content: "DUBAI: Talks between Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\
  \ concluded successfully on Thursday, with the IMF agreeing to release $518 million\
  \ by end of March as the next tranche of the three-year $6.6bn Extended Fund Facility\
  \ (EFF) programme.\x93The mission and the Pakistani authorities have reached staff-level\
  \ understandings on a Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies on the sixth\
  \ review of the program, which, upon approval by the IMF\x92s Management, will be\
  \ discussed by the IMF Executive Board. \"Upon completion of the review, SDR 360\
  \ million (about US$518 million) would be made available to Pakistan,\x94 said the\
  \ outgoing chief of the IMF Mission to Pakistan Jeffery Franks.Newly-announced Chief\
  \ of IMF Mission to Pakistan, Herald Finger, will replace Franks after the talks.At\
  \ a jointly held press conference with the IMF staff in Dubai, Finance Minister\
  \ Ishaq Dar reiterated that there would be no increase in gas and electricity prices.\
  \ Pakistan also informed the IMF of its expenditure of Rs. 150 billion on the implementation\
  \ of the National Action Plan (NAP) as well as repatriation of Internally Displaced\
  \ Persons (IDPs).Also agreed upon was Rs.60 billion in tax cuts for Pakistan, while\
  \ it was decided that the target for tax cuts should reach Rs. 2750 million by June.Dar\
  \ said that Pakistan\x92s foreign exchange reserves have increased to over $15 billion,\
  \ entitling the country to receive subsidised loans.However, due to the price reduction\
  \ of petrol in the country, tax revenue decreased to Rs. 68 billion. \x93Tax revenues\
  \ were below the second-quarter indicative target by about 0.1 percent of GDP due\
  \ in part to legal challenges to some revenue measures and to the fiscal effects\
  \ of the plunge in international oil prices,\x94 said a press statement from the\
  \ IMF mission. \x93While progress has been made in addressing the structural impediments\
  \ to higher and more inclusive growth, important challenges remain, such as steps\
  \ to enhance the independence of the SBP, permanently resolve energy sector deficiencies,\
  \ complete the legal framework for deposit insurance, and privatize or restructure\
  \ public enterprises,\x94 noted the IMF.                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
