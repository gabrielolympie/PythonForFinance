  \ 81 cents to $50.62 a barrel.\"Oil prices ... are shedding some of the strong gains\
  \ they had achieved over the two previous days,\" said Commerzbank analyst Carsten\
  \ Fritsch.\"It would appear that the initial panicky response to Saudi Arabia´s\
  \ military intervention in Yemen is giving way to a more sober assessment of the\
  \ situation.\"Prices rose sharply on Wednesday and Thursday after a Saudi Arabia-led\
  \ coalition bombed Huthi rebels in support of Yemen´s embattled President Abedrabbo\
  \ Mansour Hadi.WTI struck a one-month high of $52.48 and Brent jumped to a March\
  \ 9 peak of $59.78 on Thursday.However, the market has since pulled lower owing\

  \ which has been fanned by record US stockpiles and the OPEC cartel´s refusal to\
  \ slash production.\"Despite all this increase, we continue to see weak oil fundamentals\
  \ and thus, find it extremely hard for current prices to persist,\" said Daniel\
