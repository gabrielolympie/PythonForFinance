  \ about China´s economy following its surprise currency devaluation, while oversupply\
  \ concerns also added to downward pressure, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas\
  \ Intermediate (WTI) for September delivery fell five cents to $43.03 while Brent\
  \ crude for September slipped 35 cents to $48.83 in late-morning trade.WTI on Tuesday\
  \ sank to its lowest level since March 2009, while Brent also fell in London, after\
  \ China´s central bank moved to devalue its currency by nearly two percent against\
  \ the US dollar.The People´s Bank of China again lowered the daily fix that sets\
  \ the value of the Chinese currency against the greenback on Wednesday by 1.62 percent,\
  \ sending a new shockwave through financial markets.\"The Chinese yuan continues\
  \ to weaken for the second day, which could suggest further weakening of oil prices,\"\
  \ said Daniel Ang, an investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore.Investors\
  \ fear Beijing´s move signalled concerns over growth in the world´s second-largest\
  \ economy and top energy consumer, which came after data published over the weekend\
  \ showed a slump in Chinese trade.It also pushed up the greenback, which strengthened\
  \ further against Asian currencies on Wednesday, which hurts dollar-denominated\
  \ commodity prices by making them more expensive for international buyers.Ang said\
  \ prices were also under pressure after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting\
  \ Countries (OPEC) said output in July rose by 100,700 barrels per day from the\
  \ previous month to 31.5 million barrels per day.\"An increase in OPEC production\
  \ is certainly not ideal for the oversupplied market at this point in time,\" Ang\
  \ said.The producer cartel´s refusal to cut its output level despite sagging demand\
  \ is seen as a reason for a prolonged global oversupply, which has seen prices fall\
  \ to almost a third of their mid-2014 peak.Analysts have said the move is an attempt\
  \ by the cartel´s kingpin Saudi Arabia to defend its market share as it fends off\
  \ competition from US shale oil.Dealers will next focus on US crude stockpiles data\
  \ to be released on Wednesday for clues on demand in the world´s top crude consumer,\
  \ Ang said. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
