content: "Singapore: Oil prices fell in Asia Monday after OPEC decided to maintain\
  \ its high output levels, while traders were also weighing the possible return of\
  \ Iranian supplies that have been curtailed by international sanctions against Tehran,\
  \ analysts said. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for July delivery fell 59\
  \ cents to $58.54 while Brent crude for July eased 56 cents to $62.75 in mid-morning\
  \ trade. Analysts said investors were mulling the long-term impact on prices after\
  \ the 12-nation Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on Friday\
  \ defied calls to cut output to alleviate a global supply glut that has seen prices\
  \ slump almost 50 percent over the past year. Instead, they kept their collective\
  \ target at 30 million barrels per day -- where it has stood for more than three\
  \ and a half years.OPEC countries are reported to be actually pumping more than\
  \ 31 million barrels a day, with the risk of more coming on line.Sanjeev Gupta,\
  \ head of the Asia-Pacific oil and gas practice at business consultancy firm EY,\
  \ said prices are \"likely to remain volatile\" ahead of a June 30 deadline for\
  \ Iran and world powers to come to an agreement on curbing Tehran´s nuclear programme.\
  \  Six global powers -- Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States\
  \ -- are trying to nail down a deal to curb Iran´s nuclear ambitions by reducing\
  \ its stockpiles of enriched uranium and mothballing some of its sites.If the agreement\
  \ is reached and implemented, the powers have agreed to gradually scale back sanctions\
  \ imposed since 2012, including on its petroleum industry. Iran has the world´s\
  \ fourth-largest oil reserves but its exports have fallen from more than 2.2 million\
  \ barrels per day in 2011 to about 1.3 million because of the sanctions. \"Any likelihood\
  \ of a deal could act as a trigger for downward movement of crude prices,\" said\
  \ Gupta. (AFP) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
