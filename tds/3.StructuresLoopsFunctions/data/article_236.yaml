  \ losses after a US report stoked expectations of a global glut of suppliers.US\
  \ benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for September delivery was at $43.57,\
  \ down from $43.87 on Friday in New York -- its lowest close since March 17.Brent\
  \ crude for September was trading at $48.25 after ending at $48.61 on Friday\"It´s\
  \ still a supply story,\" Jonathan Barratt, chief investment officer at Ayers Alliance\
  \ Securities, told Bloomberg News.\"There is not a lot of upside for oil.\"Concerns\
  \ about a global supply glut were stoked on Friday when Baker Hughes said the number\
  \ of US drilling rigs rose for the third straight week.The count rose to 670, the\
  \ oil-field services firm reported -- its fifth weekly gain in six -- just days\
  \ after the US government reported an increase in oil production in the world´s\
  \ top consumer.A glut in crude oil supply is seen as the main driver for a sharp\
  \ decline in oil prices that has seen crude slump to almost a third of its mid-2014\
  \ peaks.News of rising US production comes as top producing cartel OPEC has refused\
  \ to cut output, and as investors wait for Iran to ramp up exports after a major\
  \ deal over its nuclear programme last month.In exchange for curbing its nuclear\
  \ activities, Tehran will see the lifting of sanctions, which have slashed its oil\
  \ exports.Investors predict crude prices will remain under pressure for the rest\
  \ of the year, particularly after trade and inflation data added to concerns about\
  \ China´s economy over the weekend.\"We´re expecting oil prices not to recover at\
  \ all in the second-half,\" Mark Pervan, head commodity research at Australia´s\
  \ ANZ bank, told Bloomberg. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
