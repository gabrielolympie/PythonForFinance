  \ for individuals.While addressing the National Assembly today, Dar said that a\
  \ shortfall of Rs 196 billion in revenue collection is expected this year and the\

  \ tax.The minister added that the increase in GST on petroleum products and a change\
  \ in other taxes was imperative to meet various needs including release of funds\
  \ to the provinces from the devisable pool. He also said that expenditures in the\
  \ wake of Zarb-e-Azb operation cannot be ignored, as well as factors such as debt\
  \ servicing and payment of salaries.He went on to say that the government has lowered\
