content: "London: Global oil prices fell Monday, after bumper gains before the weekend,\
  \ as many traders took profits and eyed plentiful world crude supplies, analysts\
  \ said. European benchmark Brent North Sea crude for April delivery dropped $1.26\
  \ to $61.32 a barrel in London early afternoon deals.New York´s West Texas Intermediate\
  \ (WTI) for April shed 90 cents to $48.86 a barrel.Crude futures had rebounded sharply\
  \ Friday at the end of a volatile trading week. WTI had advanced $1.59 while Brent\
  \ gained a hefty $2.53.\"Oil prices came under renewed pressure,\" said Sucden analyst\
  \ Myrto Sokou on Monday.\"Crude oil inventories continue to remain at fairly high\
  \ levels following ongoing builds of crude stocks last week.\"Oil has lost about\
  \ 50 percent of its value since June, largely due to a global supply glut partially\
  \ caused by surging US shale production.\"Although there is still a global supply\
  \ glut, oil prices are on a general increasing trend especially with the falling\
  \ rig count numbers indicating that US shale is responding to low prices,\" Ken\
  \ Hasegawa, energy trading manager at Newedge Group in Tokyo, told AFP. The weekly\
  \ Baker Hughes US drilling rig count showed the number of rigs in operation fell\
  \ by 33 to 986 in the week to February 27. The count is down 39 percent since October,\
  \ according to Bloomberg News. Analysts said dealers will next be scrutinising a\
  \ slew of US economic data to be released later Monday for clues on demand prospects\
  \ in the world´s biggest crude consumer.  (AFP)                        \r\n\r\n\r\
