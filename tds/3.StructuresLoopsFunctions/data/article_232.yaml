content: "MANILA: Gold hovered near a 5-1/2-year low on Wednesday as the dollar strengthened\
  \ after comments from a Federal Reserve official backed expectations that the U.S.\
  \ central bank would hike interest rates as early as next month.Atlanta Federal\
  \ Reserve President Dennis Lockhart has said it would take \"significant deterioration\"\
  \ in the U.S. economy for him to not support a rate hike in September, according\
  \ to the Wall Street Journal.Gold, an asset that does not earn interest, has taken\
  \ a hit given rising risks of a US rate hike. The Fed looks intent on lifting rates\
  \ this year for the first time since 2006 as the U.S. economy strengthens, particularly\
  \ its labour market.Spot gold was flat at $1,086.90 an ounce by 0606 GMT. Bullion\
  \ has stayed largely below $1,100 since breaching that key support level in a late\
  \ July rout that pulled it to as low as $1,077, its weakest since February 2010.U.S.\
  \ gold for delivery in December slipped 0.4 percent to $1,086.50 an ounce.\"We suspect\
  \ that we will see a steady grind lower across most commodity complexes, including\
  \ gold, largely attributable to the strength of the dollar and poor technicals that\
  \ will only encourage more funds to further increase their short side exposure,\"\
  \ INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir said.In fresh evidence of a recovering U.S. economy,\
  \ new orders for U.S. factory goods rebounded strongly in June. The dollar index\
  \ rose to its highest since April against a basket of major currencies.Gold may\
  \ languish below $1,100 as investors wait out Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls, said\
  \ MKS Group dealer Samuel Laughlin.Bullion could test $1,080 on Wednesday, he said,\
  \ following Lockhart's comments although some Chinese demand where onshore premium\
  \ is around $2 an ounce over the global benchmark is providing some support.Holdings\
  \ of the SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund,\
  \ dropped further on Tuesday to 21.56 million ounces, the lowest since September\
  \ 2008.Spot platinum and palladium wallowed near multi-year lows on a global glut\
  \ and weak demand from the automotive sector.Platinum was unchanged at $951.60 an\
  \ ounce, after sinking to $940.50 on Tuesday, its lowest since February 2009. Palladium\
  \ gained 0.5 percent to $595.50 after hitting $586.33 overnight, its weakest since\
  \ October 2012. Silver slipped 0.4 percent to $14.52 an ounce.                 \
