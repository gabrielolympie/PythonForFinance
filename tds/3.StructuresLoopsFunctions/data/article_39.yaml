content: "London: Oil prices advanced further Monday with buying boosted by a dip\
  \ in North American crude production, while a robust US jobs report also provided\
  \ support, analysts said. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in March\
  \ advanced $1 to $52.69 a barrel compared with Friday´s close.Brent North Sea crude\
  \ for March won 63 cents to stand at $58.43 a barrel in London afternoon trade.Last\
  \ week saw WTI surge seven percent and Brent add 9.4 percent, their best weekly\
  \ gains since February 2011.Nicholas Teo, market analyst at CMC Markets in Singapore,\
  \ said the gains were \"motivated by supply-side influences\" in the United States.A\
  \ survey by US oil services firm Baker Hughes Inc released Friday showed the number\
  \ of rigs drilling for oil in the United States fell by 83 to 1,140 in the week\
  \ to February 6. The dip followed a cut of 94 rigs the previous week.Bloomberg News\
  \ reported that the rig count was standing at its lowest level since December 2011.The\
  \ drop, coupled with announcements of deep cuts in capital spending by major oil\
  \ companies including BP and BG Group, suggests tighter supplies in the future.Oil\
  \ prices have plunged by about 50 percent from their June peaks, largely owing to\
  \ a surge in global reserves boosted by robust US shale production.Teo said a surprisingly\
  \ robust jobs report in the United States was also supporting prices as it heralds\
  \ stronger demand.The Labor Department on Friday reported that the world´s biggest\
  \ economy added 257,000 jobs in January and revised upward already healthy growth\
  \ in the previous two months.The unemployment rate edged up to 5.7 percent from\
  \ 5.6 percent, but that was in part because more people were actively seeking jobs.\
