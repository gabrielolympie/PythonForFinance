content: "New York: US oil prices shot up to a 2015 peak Wednesday after a slight\
  \ dip in US oil production sparked talk that the glutted petroleum market could\
  \ be turning.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for May delivery jumped $3.10\
  \ to $56.39 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest closing price\
  \ since December 23.European benchmark Brent oil for delivery in May rose $1.89\
  \ to $60.32 a barrel in London.The gains extended a market rally into a fifth straight\
  \ day.Earlier in the day, the US Department of Energy reported US oil production\
  \ fell by 20,000 barrels, or 0.2 percent, to 9.38 million barrels per day, in the\
  \ week ending April 10.US crude inventories stand at the highest level for this\
  \ time of year in at least the last 80 years, the DoE said, but the increase last\
  \ week was smaller than expected.Analysts expressed caution at Wednesday´s price\
  \ surge.\"I think this rally will stall,\" said Matt Smith, an analyst at Schneider\
  \ Electric. \"We got quite a bit ahead of ourselves here.\" Smith said it is likely\
  \ still too soon for the lower US rig count to meaningfully dent supply.\"Yes, there\
  \ are a couple of data points, but that doesn´t mean the US is not overflowing crude,\"\
  \ he said.Meanwhile, the Paris-based International Energy Agency cut its supply\
  \ forecast for non-OPEC countries, citing a lower outlook for US and Canadian production\
  \ and the \"worsening conflict\" in Yemen.The agency also bumped up by 90,000 barrels\
  \ per day its forecast for 2015 petroleum demand. The IEA now expects 2015 consumption\
  \ of 93.6 million barrels per day, up 1.1 million barrels per day for the year.\
