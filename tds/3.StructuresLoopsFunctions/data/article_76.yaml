content: "London: World oil prices rose Thursday on the back of the weaker dollar,\
  \ but gains were capped after US crude reserves swelled again to a record high.In\
  \ midday London deals, European benchmark Brent North Sea crude for April delivery\
  \ advanced 82 cents to $58.36 a barrel.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI)\
  \ for April added 52 cents to $48.69 a barrel.\"Despite the bearish oil inventories\
  \ report yesterday, crude oil prices rebounded in early trade this morning supported\
  \ by a slightly softer US dollar,\" said Sucden brokers analyst Myrto Sokou on Thursday.\"\
  Brent futures recovered and climbed higher towards $59 per barrel while WTI futures\
  \ rose above $48.50 per barrel.\"The weaker greenback makes dollar-denominated crude\
  \ cheaper for buyers using stronger currencies, which tends to stimulate demand\
  \ and prices.Crude futures had finished mixed Wednesday after a key report showed\
  \ US crude stockpiles had struck another record high, adding to an oversupplied\
  \ global market.The US Department of Energy said crude oil inventories surged by\
  \ 4.5 million barrels in the week to March 6 to 448.9 million.That was the highest\
  \ level since the beginning of the weekly data series in 1982.Crude prices lost\
  \ some 60 percent of their value to decline to about $40 between June and late January\
  \ owing to an oversupply in world markets, a weak global economy and the strong\
  \ dollar.Prices have since rebounded somewhat following a slowdown in US oil-drilling\
  \ activities, but analysts say volatility is likely to continue for some time.Elsewhere,\
  \ investors were monitoring the progress of talks between the United States and\
  \ other major Western powers and Iran on TehranÂ´s contested nuclear programme as\
  \ a deadline at the end of March nears.The Islamic republic has been crippled by\
  \ a series of UN and US sanctions, including on crude exports, aimed at bringing\
  \ an end to its nuclear drive, which the West says is being used to develop atomic\
  \ weapons. Iran denies the allegations.\"Prices are likely to remain in a tight\
  \ range for the next two weeks until the market gets more clarity on the ongoing\
  \ negotiations between Iran and the US over the lifting of sanctions,\" said Sanjeev\
  \ Gupta, head of the Asia-Pacific oil and gas practice at business consultancy EY.\
