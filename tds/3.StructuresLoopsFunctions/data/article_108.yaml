  \ dive seen mid-week, although demand is set to remain shackled by a global supply\
  \ glut, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in May edged\
  \ up one cent to $50.80 a barrel.Brent North Sea crude for May gained 27 cents to\
  \ $56.84 around midday in London.WTI and Brent sank 3.6 percent on Wednesday after\
  \ the US Department of Energy said commercial inventories in the world´s biggest\
  \ economy hit a record high last week.That came after Saudi Arabia´s Oil Minister\
  \ Ali al-Naimi said his country´s production had hit an all-time high of 10.3 million\
  \ barrels a day in March.Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group, has said\
  \ this week that rising imports of US crude oil could indicate improved demand prospects\
  \ in the world´s largest oil consumer or concerns about supply tightening.Price\
  \ support has meanwhile come from events concerning major oil producer Iran.Analysts\
  \ attributed steep gains at the start of the week to investors concluding that the\
  \ nuclear framework agreed between Iran and international powers will have a minimal\
  \ near-term effect on global crude supplies.The deal Tehran agreed with the United\
  \ States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany paves the way for the Islamic\
  \ republic to curtail its nuclear activity in exchange for relief from punishing\
  \ economic sanctions, including on oil investment.The United States on Thursday\
  \ warned that sanctions on Iran will be lifted in stages as a nuclear deal is implemented,\
  \ after Tehran demanded they be removed as soon as it comes into force.\"Geopolitical\
  \ factors remain a constant worry for investors with concerns regarding Iran´s nuclear\
  \ programme potentially leading to ongoing volatility in the crude oil market,\"\
