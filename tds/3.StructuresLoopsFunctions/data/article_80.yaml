content: "London: New York oil prices sank to a six-year low on Monday, falling below\
  \ $44 per barrel as the market was plagued by plentiful supplies and the strong\
  \ dollar.In earlier deals, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for April\
  \ delivery dived as low as $43.57 -- hitting the lowest since March 12, 2009.The\
  \ contract later recovered slightly to stand at $44.40, down 44 cents from Friday´s\
  \ closing level. European benchmark Brent North Sea crude for April fell 79 cents\
  \ to $53.38 a barrel in midday London trade.Crude futures had plunged by more than\
  \ two dollars on Friday after the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned of US\
  \ crude reserves reaching storage capacity with little sign of a slowdown in output\
  \ despite a global glut. \"Selling pressure was generated on Friday by the IEA,\
  \ which warned that storage capacities could soon be exhausted in the United States,\"\
  \ said Commerzbank analysts.\"The reason cited by the IEA was the massive oversupply,\
  \ which stems first and foremost from the still rising US oil production.\"The US\
  \ Department of Energy last week said stockpiles in the world´s top crude consumer\
  \ climbed to a fresh record high of 448.9 million barrels last week. \"This week\
  \ could be even more bearish for oil as there has been no shift in supply,\" Michael\
  \ McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, told AFP. Singapore-based\
  \ Phillip Futures said \"with fundamentals remaining unchanged, we hardly find a\
  \ reason for crude oil to break higher or even lower\". Crude prices lost some 60\
  \ percent of their value to decline to about $40 per barrel between June and late\
  \ January owing to an oversupply in world markets, a weak global economy and the\
  \ soaring dollar.Prices have since rebounded following a slowdown in US oil-drilling\
  \ activities, but analysts say volatility is likely to continue for some time.\"\
  Behind the facade of stability, the rebalancing triggered by the price collapse\
  \ has yet to run its course, and it might be overly optimistic to expect it to proceed\
  \ smoothly,\" the Paris-based IEA, which advises energy consuming nations, said\
  \ last week. McCarthy said oil prices are also under pressure owing to gains in\
  \ the dollar against other major currencies ahead of a closely watched US Federal\
  \ Reserve policy meeting on Wednesday. A stronger US dollar makes dollar-priced\
  \ oil more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies, denting demand. (AFP) \
