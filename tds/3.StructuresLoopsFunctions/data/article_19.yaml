content: "SINGAPORE: Saudi Arabia's new king is expected to continue a policy of keeping\
  \ oil output steady to drive out rival producers, though the royal succession has\
  \ focused market attention on the future of the kingdom's long-serving oil minister.King\
  \ Abdullah died early on Friday and his brother Salman became king, the royal court\
  \ in the world's top oil exporter said in a statement.Salman named his half-brother\
  \ Muqrin as heir, rapidly moving to forestall any succession crisis at a moment\
  \ when Saudi Arabia faces unprecedented turmoil on its borders.While the new king\
  \ is not seen as likely to change Abdullah's policies of keeping output high to\
  \ protect the OPEC cartel's market share, some analysts said the succession has\
  \ focused attention on the future of the oil minister Ali Al-Naimi.\"King Abdullah\
  \ was the architect of the current strategy to keep production high and force out\
  \ smaller players instead of cutting,\" said John Kilduff, partner, Again Capital\
  \ LLC in New York, adding that he expected Salman to keep production high.FGE analyst\
  \ Tushar Bansal said: \"By and large, as of now, no major change is expected in\
  \ Saudi policies\" but he said the market would focus on whether the oil minister\
  \ might step down.\"Ali Al-Naimi has been the oil minister since 1995... It was\
  \ reported that he expressed a desire to step down, but King Abdullah asked him\
  \ to stay on for as long as he is around. So, the real question is, if there is\
  \ a new oil minister soon, will it lead to a change in Saudi energy policy?\"IHS\
  \ oil consultant Victor Shum said speculation over the fate of the oil minister\
  \ could add to market uncertainty though he did not expect a change of minister\
  \ or in overall policy.\"The decision on Saudi Arabia to keep pumping (oil) was\
  \ made regardless of who the king may be,\" said Shum.Saudi leaders were also unlikely\
  \ to want to repeat some previous policy misfires.In the 1980s, Saudi Arabia cut\
  \ its own output to prop up prices in the face of falling demand and rising supplies\
  \ from non-OPEC suppliers but was dealt a double blow from lower prices and reduced\
  \ output.Saudi policymakers would be determined not to make the same mistake again,\
  \ analysts said.Crude oil futures jumped on Friday after news of the Saudi king's\
  \ death but later came off their highs and were still trading at levels more than\
  \ 50 percent below their most recent peaks in June, 2014. [O/R]\"This little spike\
  \ in prices is understandable... It should be sold off quickly and it won't last\
  \ long at all,\" said Mark Keenan, an analyst at Societe Generale.             \
