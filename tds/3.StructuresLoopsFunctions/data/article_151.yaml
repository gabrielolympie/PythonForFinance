  \ overshadowed the impact of geopolitical tensions in the crude-rich Middle East,\
  \ analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in June\
  \ slid 43 cents to $59 a barrel.Brent North Sea crude for July shed 63 cents to\

  \ Saudi Arabia exported just shy of eight million barrels of crude oil per day in\
  \ March -- the highest export volume in more than nine years,\" said analysts at\
  \ Commerzbank in a note to clients on Tuesday.Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG\
  \ Markets Singapore, said \"global oversupply with weak demand\" continues to put\
  \ a cap on prices despite geopolitical unrest raising concerns about a disruption\
  \ in the Middle East.He said the crude market is already \"used to\" unrest in the\
  \ region, where Islamic State fighters on Sunday captured the key Iraqi city of\
  \ Ramadi.Yemen is also engulfed in violence that analysts fear could escalate and\
  \ draw in neighbouring Saudi Arabia and Iran, which are backing the warring factions.Yemen\
  \ is not a major oil-producing country, but its coast forms one side of the Bab\
  \ el-Mandeb Strait, the key strategic entry point into the Red Sea through which\
  \ some 4.7 million barrels of oil pass each day on ships headed to or from the Suez\
  \ Canal.\"Fears that the fighting in Iraq and Yemen could hamper the oil supply\
  \ have clearly given way to a more sober appraisal, for the past twelve months have\
  \ demonstrated that such concerns are exaggerated,\" Commerzbank analysts added.\
  \ \"In actual fact, the oil supply from the region has continued to grow.\"Oil supplies\
  \ from leading OPEC producers Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates\
  \ are already near their highest levels in three decades, the International Energy\
  \ Agency (IEA) said last week. Crude futures have fought back a little in recent\
  \ weeks after prices plummeted more than 60 percent between June and January, as\
  \ the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries refused to cut production\
  \ despite a global glut.The move by the 12-nation OPEC cartel, which pumps about\
  \ 30 percent of global crude, was widely taken as an attempt to push US shale producers,\
  \ which have higher costs, out of the market. (AFP)                        \r\n\r\
