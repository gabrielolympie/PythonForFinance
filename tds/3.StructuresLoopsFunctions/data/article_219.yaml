content: "Singapore: Oil prices were mixed in Asia Thursday, with WTI stuck below\
  \ $50 a barrel after a rise in US stockpiles added to concerns over a supply glut,\
  \ analysts said.The US Department of Energy on Wednesday said the countryÂ´s commercial\
  \ crude stockpiles rose 2.5 million barrels last week, while supplies at the closely\
  \ watched Cushing, Oklahoma, hub were up 800,000 barrels.The report also showed\
  \ US production staying at near-record levels of about 9.6 million barrels per day,\
  \ bad news for a market already awash with crude from the Organization of the Petroleum\
  \ Exporting Countries (OPEC).In late-morning Asian trade, US benchmark West Texas\
  \ Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in September was up six cents at $49.25 after\
  \ closing Wednesday below $50 a barrel for the first time since April.Brent crude\
  \ for September fell six cents to $56.12.\"US inventories expanded more than expected...\
  \ which exacerbated the oversupply problem, especially when Saudi is pumping at\
  \ record production levels,\" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets Singapore.\"\
  OPEC produced 32.1 million barrels per day in June, with the largest increase coming\
  \ from Iraq and Saudi Arabia. This was 2.1 million more than what the organisation\
  \ said it will maintain,\" Aw said in a market commentary.A strong US currency is\
  \ also putting further downward pressure on oil. With the commodity priced in dollars,\
  \ it becomes more expensive for holders of weaker currencies, denting demand.\"\
  The recent run-up in the greenback presented another pressure point for crude. It\
  \ now looks like oil may move lower, with March lows of $42-$45 in the crosshairs,\"\
  \ Aw said.Expectations that the US central bank is on track to raise interest rates\
  \ this year have boosted the dollar as investors flock to the currency in the hope\
  \ of getting better returns. (AFP)                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
