content: "Singapore: Oil prices edged higher Friday following a mixed US petroleum\
  \ report that showed a healthy decline in crude and gasoline reserves but a rise\
  \ in oil production that could aggravate the global supply glut.US benchmark West\
  \ Texas Intermediate (WTI) for July rose 53 cents to $58.21 and Brent crude for\
  \ July gained 43 cents to $63.01 in afternoon trade.Daniel Ang, investment analyst\
  \ at Phillip Futures in Singapore, said in a commentary that Thursday´s US Department\
  \ of Energy petroleum report \"showed a mixed sentiment as the bearish production\
  \ increase was offset by a bullish inventory decrease\".\"As a result of this, we\
  \ were seeing the bulls and the bears fighting fiercely\".The report showed US commercial\
  \ crude inventories fell 2.8 million barrels to 479.4 million in the week through\
  \ May 22, while gasoline stockpiles fell 3.3 million barrels.But the DoE also reported\
  \ a rise in US crude production last week, by 304,000 barrels per day to 9.57 million.Dealers\
  \ have been hoping a slowdown in US output, and increased demand during the summer\
  \ driving season, could whittle down the huge global supplies that were a key reason\
  \ for the collapse in prices of more than 50 percent between June 2014 and January\
  \ this year.Ang said investors are awaiting the release of the second reading of\
  \ US first-quarter gross domestic product later Friday for clues about demand in\
  \ the world´s biggest economy. (AFP)                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
