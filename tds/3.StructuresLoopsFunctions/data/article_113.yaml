content: "KARACHI: Lending to private sector contracted by 36.5 percent during the\
  \ first nine months of the current fiscal year of 2014/15, despite the central bank\x92\
  s efforts to get credit flowing through thrice cut in policy rates, data showed\
  \ on Tuesday.Analyst said banks\x92 hefty invested into the government papers and\
  \ low borrowing costs have made little success in investment and spending by the\
  \ businesses and consumers.The flow of loans to different firms fell to Rs178.9\
  \ billion between July 1, 2014 and April 3, 2015 against Rs281.9 billion during\
  \ the same period of last fiscal year, the central bank said.Analysts said that\
  \ bank heavy investment in the government treasury reduced the supply of lendable\
  \ funds for the private sector despite falling borrowing costs.Since the start of\
  \ 2014, banks have been actively placing funds in long-term Pakistan Investment\
  \ Bonds, which carry much higher returns than the weighted average lending rate\
  \ banks get from the industrial sector.And the central bank also continued to pump\
  \ liquidity into the banking system to meet the shortage in the market because of\
  \ banks\x92 higher investment in the government papers.The State Bank of Pakistan\
  \ injected a record high Rs842 billion into the banking system on March 20, through\
  \ the opening market operations.Tuesday\x92s data on monetary aggregates depicted\
  \ that the government borrowing from commercial banks reached at high level of Rs1.230\
  \ trillion from a same period a year ago.The government\x92s rising demand for bank\
  \ borrowing has pushed out the private sector from banking.According to report from\
  \ a brokerage house, investment to deposit ratio (IDR) of banks increased to 61.2pc\
  \ in 2014 as compared to 54.1pc in the preceding year. Investment in government\
  \ securities touched new peak as such a high IDR level has never been achieved previously.Though\
  \ yields on the government papers are falling (7pc on T-bills and 8-9pc on PIBs),\
  \ an anticipation of further cut in discount rate pushes banks to lock-in funds\
  \ in PIBs on high returns.Since November 2014, the cumulative discount rate has\
  \ been reduced by 200 basis points following low inflation and positive outlook\
  \ on external sector.The government is not firmly agreed with the analysts\x92 view\
  \ that banks are not interested in extending private sector loans and parking their\
  \ whole money into the government papers.The government in its latest letter of\
  \ intent to the IMF said, \x93Private sector credit continued its healthy expansion\
  \ (10.2 percent so far in FY15) driven mainly by businesses, and in particular manufacturing.\x94\
  Some analysts foresee bank lending to start expanding in coming quarters. Within\
  \ different financing segments, a moderate pickup is expected in consumer loans.The\
  \ State Bank, with the help of World Bank experts, has developed a comprehensive\
  \ National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) to implement financial sector reforms\
  \ to meet their financing needs. The central bank is likely to launch the NFIS by\
  \ end-April 2015.In order to improve the credit information system to help banks\
  \ extend credit to broader sections of society, the Credit Bureau Act was submitted\
  \ to parliament in February 2014 and the government expects it to be enacted by\
  \ November 2015 to ensure that credit information sharing will protect the privacy\
  \ rights of individuals.Private investment and growth are hampered by impediments\
  \ in the legal framework for creditors\x92 rights and contract enforcement, barriers\
  \ to new business start-ups, complex legal, taxation and border trade requirements,\
  \ and impaired access to finance. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
