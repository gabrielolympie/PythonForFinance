  \ with Vietnam aimed at removing nearly all tariffs on goods traded between the\
  \ two countries.\"We have a deal,\" EU Trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem announced\
  \ as her office said it was \"an agreement in principle\" in two and a half years\
  \ of \"intense\" negotiations for a free trade agreement.\"This finely balanced\
  \ agreement will boost trade with one of Asia´s most dynamic economies,\" Malmstroem\
  \ said.\"It sets a new, better and modern model for free trade agreements between\
  \ the EU and developing countries, and establishes a good standard for the trade\
  \ relationship between the EU and Southeast Asia as a whole,\" she added.The announcement\
  \ followed a telephone conversation between Malmstroem and Vietnamese Industry and\
  \ Trade Minister Vu Huy HoangThe two sides had agreed on \"all issues of substance\"\
  \ and that the \"agreement will remove nearly all tariffs on goods traded between\
  \ the two economies,\" Malmstroem´s office said.Malmstroem said the deal would boost\
  \ opportunities for both EU and Vietnamese companies \"by increasing market access\
  \ for goods and services.\" She added that more than 31 million jobs in Europe --\
  \ which is suffering from high unemployment -- depend on exports.\"So having easier\
  \ access to a growing and fast developing market like Vietnam, with its 90 million\
  \ consumers, is great news,\" the commissioner said.Malmstroem said the negotiating\
  \ teams will now work on the finer points, \"settle some remaining technical issues\
  \ and finalise the legal text.\" The final version will then have to be approved\
  \ by the EU member states and the European Parliament. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
