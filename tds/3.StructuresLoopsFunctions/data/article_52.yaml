  \ stages of talks on a deal to supply Pakistan with 3 million tonnes of liquefied\
  \ natural gas (LNG) annually for 15 years, industry sources in Doha told Reuters\
  \ on Wednesday.The deal would help the country tackle serious energy shortages and\
  \ power cuts which can last up to 20 hours a day. Nearly half the country\x92s electricity\
  \ is generated by gas and its output of 4.1 billion cubic feet per day is well short\
  \ of demand for as much as 6 billion, depending on the time of year.One source said\
  \ the deal would be signed in weeks, while a second said the first shipment would\
  \ be received by March.An official at the Ministry of Water and Power confirmed\
  \ an LNG deal was planned but declined to give details. No-one at Qatargas, the\
  \ worldÂ´s largest LNG producer, was available to comment.Pakistan State Oil (PSO)\
  \ said payments to Qatar would be guaranteed by the government so any cash flow\
  \ problems at PSO would not affect the Qatargas deal.                        \r\n\
