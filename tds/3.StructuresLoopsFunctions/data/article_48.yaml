content: "Singapore: Oil prices edged higher in Asia Thursday but gains were capped\
  \ owing to concerns about surging stockpiles in the United States, the world´s top\
  \ consumer, analysts said. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for March delivery\
  \ rose 69 cents to $49.53 while Brent crude for March gained 34 cents to $55.00\
  \ in afternoon trade.\"There is some optimism in the market at the moment, but the\
  \ fundamentals have not changed,\" Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at\
  \ CMC Markets in Sydney, told AFP. \"The increased US stockpiles adds to the worry\
  \ about ample global supply, which is the main cause for the current bearish market,\"\
  \ he added. The US Department of Energy reported on Wednesday that commercial crude\
  \ reserves rose 4.9 million barrels in the week ending February 6.Stockpiles were\
  \ \"at the highest level for this time of year in at least the last 80 years\",\
  \ the agency added.Oil prices have been under pressure for months, plunging about\
  \ 60 percent to just over $40 a barrel between June and the end of January.However,\
  \ they have recovered slightly in recent weeks as the number of drilling rigs has\
  \ fallen and oil companies have trimmed some investment.Investors are also monitoring\
  \ talks on Greece´s demands to renegotiate its international bailout as the risk\
  \ of a debt default looms. A meeting between Finance Minister Yaris Varoufakis and\
  \ his counterparts from the eurozone late Wednesday broke up without agreement,\
  \ with deliberations now set to go down to the wire next week. \"We expect price\
  \ action to remain choppy as markets await for direction,\" said Singapore´s United\
  \ Overseas Bank. (AFP)                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
