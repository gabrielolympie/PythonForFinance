  \ requirements to get credit flowing more easily in the world´s largest energy consumer.West\
  \ Texas Intermediate for May delivery climbed 64 cents to close at $56.38 a barrel\
  \ on the New York Mercantile Exchange.In London, Brent North Sea crude for June\
  \ delivery, the global benchmark, was unchanged from Friday at $63.45 a barrel.China´s\
  \ central bank announced Sunday it was cutting the reserve requirement ratio, the\
  \ amount of cash that commercial banks must hold in reserve, by one percentage point,\
  \ the second such move this year to boost lending. The move took effect Monday.\"\
  While additional RRR cuts were expected throughout 2015, the size and timing of\
  \ this cut indicates leaders are more deeply concerned about the state of the economy\
  \ than official comments previously indicated,\" said Brian Jackson, China economist\
  \ at IHS Global Insight.Jackson noted it was the largest RRR reduction since November\
  \ 2008 amid the global financial crisis.Lifted in early trade by the Chinese action,\
  \ prices retraced some gains after Saudi Arabia´s oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, pointed\
  \ to strong crude production, only for prices to rise again on a bullish forecast\
  \ for US inventories.\"It´s been choppy,\" said John Kilduff of Again Capital.Investors,\
  \ he said, are \"trying to determine when the production tide is going to turn\"\
  \ in the United States, which has been pumping out historic amounts of crude despite\
  \ a global supply glut.Kilduff said a report by energy information company Genscape,\
  \ showing that crude reserves at the key storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, had fallen\
  \ by 900,000 barrels, had boosted trader sentiment.Dealers are also reading a drop\
  \ in US oil rig activity as a sign of a production slowdown that could alleviate\
  \ the global oversupply and push up prices that have halved since mid-2014.\"There\
  \ may be scope for oil prices to be lifted further in the near term both by falling\
  \ US oil output and crude stock data, and by better news on the demand side from\
  \ the economies of the US, eurozone and China,\" said Julian Jessop, head of commodities\
  \ research at Capital Economics. (AFP)                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
