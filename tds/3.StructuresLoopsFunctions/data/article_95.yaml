content: "SINGAPORE: Oil prices fell on Monday as traders focused on whether Iran\
  \ and six world powers would reach a deal that could add fuel to an already oversupplied\
  \ market if sanctions against Tehran are lifted.The two sides are trying to reach\
  \ an agreement in nuclear negotiations by a Tuesday deadline.\"Any relaxation of\
  \ Iran oil sanctions could see increased exports adding to swelling global supplies\
  \ and further pressuring prices,\" ANZ said.Brent crude futures were down 42 cents\
  \ at $55.99 by 0633 GMT as the market began to price in a potential deal with Iran.\
  \ U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) was down 84 cents at $48.03 a barrel.Barclays\
  \ said that the U.S. build-up in stocks would make its way into an already oversupplied\
  \ market in the second quarter and that global demand would unlikely be strong enough\
  \ to support oil prices once that happens.\"In OECD Asia, demand growth actually\
  \ fell from -3 percent to -4 percent (in Q1) ... Apparent demand in China was around\
  \ 2 percent higher, but actual demand is likely to be lower since seasonal stockbuilding\
  \ typically takes place after the start of the year,\" the bank said. It added that\
  \ demand growth in the OECD region had been in structural decline over the past\
  \ five years.\"Continued dollar strength is (also) a headwind to the oil price recovery,\"\
  \ Barclays said, forecasting the dollar rising slightly above parity with the euro\
  \ by Q4.A potential climb in prices could come from an OPEC production cut, which\
  \ some members have lobbied for but its biggest exporter Saudi Arabia has resisted.\"\
  Saudi Arabia had to cut its price in Asia to ensure its crude oil remained attractive,\"\
  \ energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said.\"Other suppliers looking to position themselves\
  \ in Asia will have to pay close attention to the Saudi's pricing strategy,\" it\
  \ added.Morgan Stanley said that crude demand would also be dented via the refinery\
  \ sector, where production tends to fall towards the middle of the year.In the United\
  \ States, the oil rig count continued to drop, although analysts said that lower\
  \ drilling activity would only affect oil production later this year.\"The current\
  \ rig count is pointing to U.S. production declining slightly sequentially in 2Q15\
  \ and 3Q15,\" Goldman Sachs said although it added activity could bounce back in\
  \ 2016 as drillers benefitted from falling production costs.                   \
