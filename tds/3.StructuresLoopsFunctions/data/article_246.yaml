content: "Singapore: Oil prices fell in Asia Wednesday, giving up meagre gains in\
  \ the previous session as investors await a US inventory report to gauge demand\
  \ in the world´s top economy.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for September\
  \ delivery fell 17 cents to $42.45 a barrel and Brent crude for October dipped 23\
  \ cents to $48.58 a barrel in late-morning Asian trade.Both contracts eked out modest\
  \ rebounds in closing deals in New York on Tuesday.But analysts said prices were\
  \ unlikely to stage a sustained rally because the market remains awash with supplies\
  \ from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi\
  \ Arabia.Oil traders are also watching a report on US crude inventories in the week\
  \ ending August 14 due later Wednesday to measure demand in the world´s biggest\
  \ economy and large producer of shale oil.Analysts expect inventories to decline,\
  \ but also said stockpile levels remain high after a weaker-than-hoped rise in demand\
  \ during the summer driving season.\"Output in the US has turned out to be more\
  \ robust than many had previously assumed, as shale firms have dramatically slashed\
  \ costs and increased their efficiency rather than cutting production,\" said Thomas\
  \ Pugh, commodities economist at research firm Capital Economics.Demand growth is\
  \ not keeping pace with supply, especially with the slowdown in China, the world´s\
  \ top energy consuming nation and its second-biggest economy.Iran last month also\
  \ reached an agreement with major world powers to rein in its nuclear ambitions\
  \ in exchange for the lifting of crippling Western economic sanctions which have\
  \ restricted its oil exports.\"This renewed decline in oil prices has largely been\
  \ driven by a combination of concerns about demand, notably from China, and continued\
  \ strong growth in supply,\" said Pugh.\"OPEC has increased its output by almost\
  \ 1.4 million barrels per day since January and the potential return of exports\
  \ from Iran early next year could exacerbate the supply glut,\" he said. \r\n\r\n\
