content: "SHANGHAI: China's tumbling stock market showed signs of seizing up on Wednesday,\
  \ as companies scrambled to escape the rout by having their shares suspended and\
  \ indexes plunged after the securities regulator warned of \"panic sentiment\" gripping\
  \ investors.Beijing, which has struggled for more than a week to bend the market\
  \ to its will, unveiled yet another battery of measures to arrest the sell-off,\
  \ and the People's Bank of China said it would step up support to brokerages enlisted\
  \ to prop up shares.The CSI300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai\
  \ and Shenzhen closed down 6.8 percent, while the Shanghai Composite Index dropped\
  \ 5.9 percent.With nearly half the market on a trading halt and another round of\
  \ margin calls forcing leveraged investors to dump whatever shares could find a\
  \ buyer, blue chips that had been supported by stabilisation funds earlier in the\
  \ week bore the brunt.\"I've never seen this kind of slump before. I don't think\
  \ anyone has. Liquidity is totally depleted,\" said Du Changchun, an analyst at\
  \ Northeast Securities.\"Originally, many wanted to hold blue chips. But since so\
  \ many small caps are suspended from trading, the only way to reduce risk exposure\
  \ is to sell blue chips.\"More than 30 percent has been knocked off the value of\
  \ Chinese shares since mid-June, and for some global investors the fear that China's\
  \ market turmoil will destabilise the real economy is now a bigger risk than the\
  \ crisis in Greece.\"Also, the ripple effect from the market correction has yet\
  \ to show up,\" wrote Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts in a note. \"We expect\
  \ slower growth, poorer corporate earnings, and a higher risk of a financial crisis.\"\
  Commodities markets reflected growing concerns about the broader health of the world's\
  \ second largest economy, with copper prices falling to a six-year low, Shanghai\
  \ nickel futures sliding by their 5 percent daily limit, and oil falling towards\
  \ $56 a barrel, near a three month-low.TRADING HALTSMore than 500 China-listed firms\
  \ announced trading halts on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges on Wednesday, taking\
  \ total suspensions to about 1,300 - 45 percent of the market or roughly $2.4 trillion\
  \ worth of stock - as companies scuttled to sit out the carnage.With so many small-cap\
  \ companies sheltering on the sidelines, the ChiNext growth board, which has seen\
  \ some of the biggest swings in valuations, fell a modest 0.8 percent.The plunge\
  \ in China's previously booming stock markets, which had more than doubled in the\
  \ year to mid-June, is a major headache for President Xi Jinping and China's top\
  \ leaders, who are already grappling with slowing growth.Beijing's interventionist\
  \ response has also raised questions about its ability to enact the market liberalisation\
  \ steps that are a centrepiece of its economic reform agenda.China has orchestrated\
  \ brokerages and fund managers to promise to buy billions of dollars' worth of stocks,\
  \ helped by a state-backed margin finance company which the central bank pledged\
  \ on Wednesday to provide sufficient liquidity.The securities regulator said the\
  \ Securities Finance Corp had provided 260 billion yuan ($41.8 billion) to 21 brokerages,\
  \ though that sum is only 40 percent of the amount of leveraged positions that investors\
  \ have cut since June 18.RETAIL INVESTORSUnlike other major stock markets, which\
  \ are dominated by professional money managers, retail investors account for around\
  \ 85 percent of China trade, which exacerbates volatility.\"It's uncommon to see\
  \ so many shares posting consecutive daily limit falls, and the index futures swinging\
  \ so wildly,\" said Wang Feng, CEO and founder of hedge fund firm Alpha Squared\
  \ Capital Co and a former Wall Street trader.\"It's a stampede. And the problem\
  \ of the market is that all the players move in the same direction, and are too\
  \ emotional.\"A surprise interest-rate cut by the central bank at the end of June,\
  \ relaxations in margin trading and other \"stability measures\" have done little\
  \ to calm investors.The barrage of official commentary and new support measures\
  \ continued throughout Wednesday's trading session, without visible effect.Deng\
  \ Ge, a spokesman for the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said in remarks\
  \ posted on its official channel on Weibo, China's version of Twitter, that there\
  \ had been a big increase in \"irrational selling\" of stocks.Government agencies\
  \ also announced that insurers would be allowed to by more blue chips and urged\
  \ major shareholders and top executives to buy their own shares.But the market sell-off\
  \ has extended beyond the mainland, with Chinese stocks on US exchanges falling\
  \ as much as 6.1 percent on Tuesday, according to the Bank of New York Mellon index\
  \ of such securities.Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 5.8 percent, with shares of\
  \ Chinese brokerages taking a heavy beating.\"Investors are extremely unimpressed\
  \ with their sudden conscription into national service, and you can see that in\
  \ their share prices,\" said Matthew Smith, a strategist who covers the China financials\
  \ sector for Macquarie.                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
