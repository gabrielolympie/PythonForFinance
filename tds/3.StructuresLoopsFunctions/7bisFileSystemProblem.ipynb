    "### **Problem: Automated Article Tagging and Reporting**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Scenario**\n",
    "You're an analyst at a financial news aggregator. You have a collection of articles, each saved as a separate YAML file in a directory. Your task is to write a script that can automatically read all these articles, tag them based on keywords in their content, and then generate a summary report showing how many articles fall under each tag, broken down by category.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Setup**\n",
    "For this problem, assume you have a folder named `articles`. Inside this folder are several `.yaml` files (e.g., `article1.yaml`, `article2.yaml`, etc.). You do **not** need to create these files; your script should be written to work with them as if they already exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each YAML file has the following structure:\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "# Example: article1.yaml\n",
    "title: \"Federal Reserve Hints at New Policy Shift\"\n",
    "category: \"Economy\"\n",
    "content: \"Today, the central bank discussed its market investment strategy and future regulation. This new policy could impact the entire economy.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Your Task**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Import Modules and Define Constants**:\n",
    "    *   Import the `os` and `yaml` modules.\n",
    "    *   Define the path to your articles folder: `ARTICLES_DIR = 'articles'`.\n",
    "    *   Define a list of tags you want to search for. These are your keywords.\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        TAGS_TO_FIND = ['policy', 'market', 'investment', 'stock', 'economy', 'regulation', 'trade', 'finance']\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **File Discovery and Initialization**:\n",
    "    *   Check if the `ARTICLES_DIR` exists using `os.path.exists()`. If not, print an error and stop.\n",
    "    *   If it exists, get a list of all filenames within it using `os.listdir()`.\n",
    "    *   Initialize an empty dictionary called `category_tag_counts`. This will be your main data structure to store the results. It will look like this by the end: `{'Economy': {'policy': 1, 'market': 2}, 'Technology': {'stock': 3}}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Process Each Article File**:\n",
    "    *   Start a `for` loop to iterate through each `filename` in the list you got from `os.listdir()`.\n",
    "    *   **Inside the loop**:\n",
    "        *   Construct the full path to the current file using `os.path.join(ARTICLES_DIR, filename)`.\n",
    "        *   Use a `with open(...)` block to open the file.\n",
    "        *   Use a `try-except` block to handle potential errors. In the `try` block, load the YAML file content into a dictionary called `article_data` using `yaml.safe_load()`. If a `yaml.YAMLError` occurs, print a warning and `continue` to the next file.\n",
    "        *   Extract the `category` and `content` from `article_data`. Convert the `content` to lowercase (`.lower()`) to make tag searching case-insensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Tagging and Counting**:\n",
    "    *   **Still inside the main loop**:\n",
    "        *   Check if the article's `category` is already a key in your `category_tag_counts` dictionary. If not, add it with an empty dictionary as its value: `category_tag_counts[category] = {}`.\n",
    "        *   Start a nested `for` loop to iterate through your `TAGS_TO_FIND` list.\n",
    "        *   For each `tag` in the list, check if it is present in the lowercase `content` string (`if tag in content:`).\n",
    "        *   If the tag is found, you need to increment its count for the current article's category. Use the `.get()` method to do this safely:\n",
    "            ```python\n",
    "            # Get the current count of the tag in this category, defaulting to 0 if not found\n",
    "            current_count = category_tag_counts[category].get(tag, 0)\n",
    "            # Increment and update the count\n",
    "            category_tag_counts[category][tag] = current_count + 1\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Generate the Final Report**:\n",
    "    *   **After the main loop has finished**:\n",
    "    *   Print a header for your report.\n",
    "    *   Loop through the `category_tag_counts` dictionary using `.items()` to get both the category and its tag data.\n",
    "    *   For each `category`, print its name as a sub-header.\n",
    "    *   Then, loop through the tags and counts for that category and print them in a formatted way."
