    "\n",
    "So far, all the data we've worked with has been created directly inside our code (e.g., `start_price = 225.40`). In any real-world business or finance scenario, this is rarely the case. Data lives in files: transaction logs, market data exports, configuration settings, and reports.\n",

    "To build powerful applications, our Python scripts must be able to **read** data from these files. This process is called **File I/O** (Input/Output). We'll learn how to navigate the file system to find our files and how to parse different file formats, from simple text to structured data like JSON and YAML."

    "### **7.1 Navigating Your Computer: The `os` Module**\n",
    "Before you can open a file, you need to know where it is. The `os` module in Python provides a way to interact with the operating system, allowing you to work with file paths and directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Functions:**\n",
    "*   `os.getcwd()`: **G**et **C**urrent **W**orking **D**irectory. Shows where your script is currently running from.\n",
    "*   `os.listdir(path)`: Lists all files and folders in a given directory path. This is key for processing multiple files in a folder.\n",
    "*   `os.path.exists(path)`: Returns `True` if a file or directory exists at the given path, `False` otherwise. Crucial for checking if a file is available before trying to open it.\n",
    "*   `os.path.join(path1, path2, ...)`: Intelligently combines path components. It automatically uses the correct separator (`/` or `\\`) for your operating system, making your code portable.\n",
    "*   `os.makedirs(path, exist_ok=True)`: Creates a directory. `exist_ok=True` prevents an error if the directory already exists."

    "### **7.2 Reading Plain Text Files (`.txt`)**\n",
    "The simplest type of file is a plain text file, often used for logs or simple lists. The best practice for handling files is using the `with open(...)` statement. It creates a temporary context and **automatically closes the file for you** when you are done, even if an error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('path/to/your/file.txt', 'r') as file_object:\n",
    "    # Code to work with the file goes here\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Methods for Reading Text Files:**\n",
    "Once the file is open, you can read its contents in several ways.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Assume we have a file 'tickers.txt' with the content:\n",
    "# AAPL\n",
    "# MSFT\n",

    "3.  **Calculate Total Shares**: Building on step 2, initialize a `total_shares` variable to 0. Inside your loop, access the number of shares (it will be a string, so you'll need to convert it to an `int`), and add it to `total_shares`. After the loop, print the final total."
